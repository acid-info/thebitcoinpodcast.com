					<description><![CDATA[Hi Kenn!
Started to hear your podcast&#039;s last day at work and finished all today! Fucking good job man.
Really enjoy listening to your interview&#039;s and your reflection on the cryptomarket. 

Remember to keep it simple. As a &quot;newbie&quot; it can get quite confusing when you base a whole conversation on a term or word that the audience do not understand, yet. Would be great to have a quick follow up on just some of the terms, while you are doing the conversations. It will not use lots of your time and it would make the understanding so much easier instead of me going to google while listening. 
What I miss as well is the overall update on the market - don&#039;t get me wrong, you do it sometimes, but I think you should start out every time giving an description of the last or the future day/weeks/month. This keeps the show excited and the audience get a feeling of whats going on in the cryptoworld every time we are listening to your podcast. This could be about basic news, your own investments, exciting altcoins to watch an so on. You do it now, but you do it to rare in my opinion. 

Anyway I enjoy in the way your speak, your questions and differential reflections and the people you bring in. As on of the participating guys said &quot;you have a straight up radiovoice&quot;. Thank you for that! I need more!!

Big up from Denmark!!]]></description>
