					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/announcements-dnotes/#comment-419&quot;&gt;Tim&lt;/a&gt;.

Hi Tim.
I really appreciate the Reply!
I have been a big fan of DNotes ever since I first heard of them about 6 months ago.
I bought a few and locked them up for 5 years in the DNotes Vault.
I will watch for the switch to POS and be sure to use minergate to run a node and participate in the project.
All the best!
Harvey]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Hi Clay. This is Tim from the podcast you listened to. I&#039;m glad you enjoyed it.

It is still possible to mine DNotes currently through proof-of-work, however because it runs a scrypt algorithm, you generally require specialized mining hardware to do so. Back when I was mining (2014), these specialized computers weren&#039;t that commonplace, and the profitability mining on a home machine was much better. In the next month or two, DNotes will be switching to Proof-Of-Stake to replace Proof-Of-Work. This will mean that existing holders of DNotes will essentially be paid an interest on their DNotes positions, in exchange for running a node (version of the wallet) on their computer in order to support the strength and decentralization of the network. 

An easy way to mine on a standard computer would be to use &#039;point and click&#039; software like &quot;minergate&quot;. You could automatically mine the most efficient currency at any given time, sell them on the market, and then swap then into DNotes. This could however take some time to mine a meaningful amount.

I hope you find this helpful.
Tim.

I would personally recommend buying DNotes from cryptopia.co.nz. Otherwise, there are GPU]]></description>
