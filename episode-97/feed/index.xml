					<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m completely baffled about your talks about age and ability to change. It&#039;s based on your small experience with your teacher and your mum. It reflects very well your small point of view on changing health care. 
You keep one thing stable, i.e. current health care with it&#039;s institution and way of organisation. You praise Obama health care for example. You try to put current health care databases on blockchain tech. And so more. On the other side you try to implement a brand new blockchain tech on the current health system. This is going nowhere, dudes.
If you really wanna change then you&#039;ve to look with an open eye on what&#039;s happening. It&#039;s not difficult to see because it&#039;s a process of centuries long. It&#039;s all about self-empowerment and decentralisation. The self-empowerment gives you the tools to do whatever you want: share knowledge, value, things and whatever. The decentralisation is important for the governance. You or a group can govern what happens and nobody can stop you from doing it.
For health care, expect dramatic changes: all kind of Apps to check and manipulate your body, open source medication, local personalised printing of medication, blockchain storages of data with big data possibilities, and take into account what nano-tech can do, .....
Please go from there and do another podcast about health care.
Cheers,
