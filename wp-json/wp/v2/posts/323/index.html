Him and his team at Airbitz are bonafide digital wallet-smiths. Airbitz Wins! They win the wallet war by finding the perfect balance between privacy, safety, security, and simplicity.<\/p>\n<p>Privacy is a new problem. \u00a0As technology advances and widely spreads privacy is becoming not-so private. \u00a0In today\u2019s social media driven interactions it is very likely that something that you say or do will end up on someone\u2019s Snapchat story, or someone\u2019s YouTube page. \u00a0As all facets of our lives get turned into data, or in the words of the amazing 80\u2019s show, \u201c<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=M678PVOf5F0\/\" target=\"_blank\">Captain Power and the Soldiers of the Future<\/a>,\u201d we become digitized and morphed into 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s. \u00a0Digitized versions of you or floating all over the interwebs and landing in places you may not want them to be. \u00a0So, in a world where you have to be digitized just to exist, no really&#8230;a lot of employers will not employ you if you do not have a social media presence, then how do you protect your 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s? How do you keep things private? Airbitz uses the power and slickness of encryption to keep you private&#8230;to keep your 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s with you. \u00a0Firstly, they don\u2019t want your address, email , or phone number. \u00a0Secondly, they encrypt everything on the client-side, that is your side o\u2019awesome user! \u00a0All of your information is encrypted before it drops into the internet ocean. \u00a0I will put it like this, unencrypted data to an internet bad dude is like blood to a shark&#8230;they\u2019ll find it. Lastly&#8230;Hiearchal Deterministic Wallets capable of changing your sending address with every purchase. \u00a0A little pro-tip for the users&#8230;changing your sending address every time you send bits highly protects you from the internet sharks, well, Airbitz\u2019s wallet will do it for you. \u00a0In my opinion as a long term bitcoin user, when it comes to privacy, Airbitz wins!<\/p>\n<p>Banks, they are pretty sore subject matter in the bitcoin community. \u00a0Why? Because they suck, literally. \u00a0They leech wealth from the unwealthy to perpetuate their own wealth&#8230;that is nasty nasty business. \u00a0Let\u2019s rewind the clock, banks exist for a real reason and a good one. Thousands of years ago, if your neighbor up\u2019d and decided he wanted to come over to your property and take your gold bullions, all he would need is will and better weapons than you. \u00a0One genius guy said, \u201cHey, I\u2019ll hold your money at a tiny fee&#8230;I\u2019m going to take everyone\u2019s fees and spend that money to protect everyone\u2019s money.\u201d \u00a0Banks kept money safe, and they were needed. \u00a0But&#8230;now they aren\u2019t! \u00a0Airbitz cuts a bank out, and these modern banks need to be cut out because they have forgotten their purpose. \u00a0Not even Airbitz can get to your funds. \u00a0This was taken directly from the FAQ on their site:<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Q: Does Airbitz have access to my Bitcoin funds or personal info?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><strong>A:<\/strong> No, neither Airbitz nor any third party can access the private keys, or even the public addresses and transactional metadata of any users. Private and public keys are generated on the user\u2019s device and encrypted using THEIR login\/password (Airbitz has no ability to decrypt the data). The encrypted data is then stored on their device and backed up to peer-to-peer cloud servers with a very high level of redundancy. User\u2019s can access their funds from any compatible iPhone or Android device using the Airbitz mobile app and the same login &amp; password.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Now ask yourself, if Airbitz does not have access to your funds, then how in the world can anyone else when they are encrypted on your side? In my opinion as a long term bitcoin user, when it comes to safety, Airbitz wins!<\/p>\n<p>Safety has a sibling and that sibling is security. \u00a0Internet security is a very lucrative field these days. \u00a0If you have a website, then securing it should now be on the forefront of your mind. \u00a0Not a last minute custodial afterthought. \u00a0The team at Airbitz built this wallet from the ground up with C\/C++ and heavy encryption with password hashes. <a href=\"https:\/\/airbitz.co\/go\/faq\/encryption-keys-generated-airbitz\/\" target=\"_blank\">Security<\/a>, is the foundation of this wallet. Not the frame, not the plumbing, not the drywall&#8230;it is the foundation. In my opinion as a long term bitcoin user, when it comes to security, Airbitz wins!<\/p>\n<p>I had an old professor that was more than generous with his office hours. \u00a0He was around 70 years old and had lived such an amazing life as an engineer. It just so happened that I had a block of free time in my schedule that coincided with his. \u00a0After the very first day of class I walked into his office and said, \u201c<em>I just listened to you lecture for 90 minutes, and I didn\u2019t understand a single noun you used.<\/em>\u201d \u00a0He laughed&#8230;I laughed. \u00a0Then he told me, \u201c<em>You need to drop this class<\/em>.\u201d \u00a0I told him, \u201c<em>That\u2019s not an option.<\/em>\u201d \u00a0For an entire semester he taught me foundations of electrical engineering from knowing zero things about electricity to using Ohm\u2019s, Kirchhoff&#8217;s, and Joule\u2019s Laws like a true boss should. \u00a0I mean boss in the colloquial sense&#8230;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=NisCkxU544c\/\" target=\"_blank\">like how a rapper would use it<\/a>. The one thing I tell my students that he told me at least three times a week, \u201c<em>You need to <a href=\"http:\/\/dc-digital.net\/sites\/default\/files\/pictures\/keep-it-simple-stupid.jpg\/\" target=\"_blank\">KISS<\/a> the problems&#8230;Keep It Simple Stupid<\/em>.\u201d \u00a0By the end of the semester it got to the point where he would even bop me on the forehead like those V8 commercials. \u00a0Where am I going with this? \u00a0Airbitz keeps it simple. \u00a0There are a slew of features in this wallet for the users, but by far the standout feature is the business directory. \u00a0No longer do you have to wonder where you can spend your bitcoin. The very moment you finish setting up the wallet you are met with a directory of business nearest to you that accept bitcoin&#8230;and the user interface rides smoother than a Mercedes on the autobahn. \u00a0Not to mention multiple wallets per account with editable metadata. \u00a0Oh yeah&#8230;automatic wallet encryption, automatic backups, and multiple device synchronization! \u00a0This wallet is the standard! \u00a0And, all other wallets in the game&#8230;they need to take notes. \u00a0In my opinion as a long term bitcoin user, when it comes to simplicity, Airbitz wins!<\/p>\n<p>So&#8230;as a company, Paul Puey and his team have built the Ferrari of bitcoin wallets. Such unrelenting focus on privacy, safety, security, and simplicity is why, in my opinion as a long term bitcoin user, Airbitz wins!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is Airbitz? \u00a0Well&#8230;Airbitz is a company first and foremost. \u00a0An amazing company that conveys levels of dedication to their product and customer service that are few and far between these days. \u00a0We at TBP had the immense pleasure of interviewing the CEO of Airbitz, Paul Puey. \u00a0And, during the interview I began to understand [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":303,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","unlock_protocol_post_locks":"","publish_to_discourse":"","publish_post_category":"","wpdc_auto_publish_overridden":"","wpdc_topic_tags":"","wpdc_pin_topic":"","wpdc_pin_until":"","discourse_post_id":"","discourse_permalink":"","wpdc_publishing_response":"","wpdc_publishing_error":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/323"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=323"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/323\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":354,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/323\/revisions\/354"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/303"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=323"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=323"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=323"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
