To start off this season, we spoke to Paul Berg, CEO and Co-Founder of Sablier Finance. Many have sought to scale Ethereum transactions off-chain, with the use of Roll-ups\/Plasma\/State Channels, but Paul&#8217;s team took a different approach. They&#8217;re building an on-chain protocol for real-time payments; one that&#8217;s lean, extendable, and a great PoC into how the future of real-time finance will work going forward. Join this enlightening discussion into his design decisions, and why he thinks Sablier is going to revolutionize payments by allowing you to stream digitized value of any form.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Links:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/sablier.finance\/\">Sablier Website<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/sablierhq\/sablier\">Sablier GitHub<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Intro\/Outro Music \u201cRosethroat\u201d by YTK:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/yungtrvpkid\/rosethroat\">SoundCloud<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Show Sponsor(s):<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/amentum.org\/\">Amentum<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer: This is not investment advice, it is an engaged discussion on new technology; BlockChannel reminds you to always do your own due diligence before investing in any crypto-related project in the industry.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>&amp;nbsp; On this episode of BlockChannel, McKie, Dr. Petty and Dee are back with a new season, with fresh new faces and guests.
