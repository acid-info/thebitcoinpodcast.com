Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Timothy Goggin from DNotes. DNotes is a blockchain-powered digital currency and peer-to-peer payment system that empowers users to send money to one another \u2013 quickly, efficiently, and without the expense of going through an intermediary middleman. With DNotes, we\u2019re bridging the divide between traditional centralized monetary systems and the new decentralized models. The DNotes currency is supported by a business ecosystem based on sound business principles, in which every component is integrated to create a solid foundation that can be rapidly and reliably scaled to need. Our commitment to building the supporting infrastructure before initiating the riskier technological expansion is a winning strategy that should appeal to anyone familiar with the world of business and investment. Each component in the DNotes ecosystem operates synergistically with the others, helping to power the entire system. Our ultimate vision is focused on DNotes becoming the premiere vehicle to bring the benefits of digital currency to the entire globe.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/dnotescoin.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http:\/\/dnotescoin.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Timothy Goggin, Executive Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
