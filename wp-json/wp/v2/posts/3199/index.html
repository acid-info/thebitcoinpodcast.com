In it, he revealed a new protocol dubbed &#8220;Mimblewimble&#8221; after the tongue-tying curse in Harry Potter, because &#8220;it is used to prevent the blockchain from talking about all user&#8217;s information&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>In the time since, multiple researchers and developers have continued to flesh out and build on Jedusor&#8217;s innovation, in many respects led by Andrew Poelstra, a Bitcoin developer and mathematician at Blockstream.<\/p>\n<p>This deep dive with Andrew covers the technical details of Mimblewimble&#8217;s scaling and privacy-enhancing features, discusses the real world logistics of using the protocol, and looks at some of the coolest features enabled by the technology.
