With crypto being so unpredictable, we thought it would be fun for our new listeners to check out episodes of our older content. It\u2019s like opening up a time capsule! Originally aired in February 2016, Episode 38 focused on the question of \u201chow to store your bitcoins\u201d which leads to one of the most important decisions for a Bitcoin user to make. But like Reading Rainbow, you don\u2019t have to take our word for it. Joining us this week is Alena Vranova, business developer, Co-founder of SatoshiLabs, and the creator of TREZOR. She chatted with us about crypto, economy, security, questions of life, everything! It\u2019s a good listen.
