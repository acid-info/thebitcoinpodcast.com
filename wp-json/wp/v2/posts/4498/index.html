Then we jump into our special interview for the episode, Mr. Andrew Yang, Democratic candidate for President of the United States in 2020.

He believes this is necessary because technology will soon automate away millions of American jobs &#8211; and yes, indeed, this has already begun. Oh, and he accepts crypto donations for his campaign. That is one savvy guy!<\/p>\n<p>ARCANE BEAR SOCIAL MEDIA CIRCLE?<\/p>\n<p>?? Steemit:  ?? Linkedin:  ?? Google : ?? Twitter:  ??
