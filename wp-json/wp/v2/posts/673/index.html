But instead of visiting websites, you&#8217;d be visiting someone&#8217;s wallet. CEO of Netki,\u00a0Justin Newton, joins us in the studio this week to discuss both usability and user security. In the past, he co-founded what became the largest trade association for Internet Provider&#8217;s, helping to pass the Internet Tax Moratorium. He led technology teams at 3 $1B+ IPO&#8217;s, and created early standards around DoS attack prevention. After 20 years in the Internet startup scene, he took his experience from the early commercialization of the Internet and applied it to the Bitcoin ecosystem, looking for barriers to mass market adoption that needed to be solved across the industry. \u00a0Wait, did he say MASS ADOPTION?
