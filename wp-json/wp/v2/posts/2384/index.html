With the high demand and application pliability, it is only natural that more cryptocurrency forms have emerged in addition to Bitcoin. This post provides a good overview of the alternative cryptocurrencies available and their differences from Bitcoin.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/litecoin.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Litecoin<\/a> launched in 2011 and was one of the first to launch post-Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency was<br \/>\ncreated by Charlie Lee, a MIT graduate and former Google engineer, and modeled after Bitcoin\u2019s open<br \/>\nsource (with changes, of course). Litecoin\u2019s network is also devoid of any central authority or financial institution. At the time of its founding, it was lauded as the \u2018silver\u2019 to Bitcoin\u2019s \u2018gold\u2019. The first difference to note between Litecoin and Bitcoin is their algorithm, with the former running on Scrypt and the latter running on SHA-256. Scrypts are encoded blocks of information that are decoded by CPUS (miners, essentially). Perhaps the biggest difference is the mean block time between the two currency forms. Bitcoin\u2019s average time to generate a block is 10 minutes, whereas Litecoin\u2019s is 2.5. Litecoin\u2019s Scrypt algorithms coupled with their faster mean block time fosters confirming transactions much faster than Bitcoin. The blockchain can handle a higher volume of transactions and do so without requiring any updates to the network. Interestingly enough, there is a rumor that Charlie Lee also created Bitcoin, although that rumor has been dispelled by the Litecoin founder.<\/p>\n<p>Another viable cryptocurrency is <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ethereum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ethereum<\/a>, or Ether. Ether launched in 2015 and has a more<br \/>\ncomprehensive software platform that supports SmartContracts and Distributed Applications on the<br \/>\nnetwork. Ether is also considered its own Turning-complete programming language running on a<br \/>\nblockchain. This helps developers build their distributed applications. As of now, Ether\u2019s two main purposes are being traded as a digital currency and used inside Ethereum to run applications. Ether\u2019s transactions are verified much faster than Bitcoin\u2019s as part of their streamlined platform. The main difference between Ether and Bitcoin is that Ether is more than just a cryptocurrency. It is a platform that monetizes peer-to- peer contracts and digital applications. The two cryptocurrencies cannot truly be compared because Ethereum has a different purpose. It\u2019s also worth noting that while there are <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ethereumgamblingsites.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">several gambling sites that accept Ethereum<\/a>, it\u2019s most certainly not as popular as Bitcoin in the gambling arena. Whether or not that will change in time remains to be seen.<\/p>\n<p>Dash is like Bitcoin\u2019s stepbrother. Launched in 2014, Dash (originally called Darkcoin) created a more anonymous version of Bitcoin that runs on a decentralized mastercode network that makes transactions virtually untraceable. The cryptocurrency was rebranded as Dash back in 2015 and still offers the same anonymity that helped it gain its following. Dash\u2019s blockchain supports more transactions at a time and features instant transaction verification.<\/p>\n<p>Ripple is an interesting alternative to Bitcoin because it operates on a network that does not require mining. This cryptocurrency was launched in 2012 and facilitates international transactions with lower costs and faster processing times. Instead of a blockchain, Ripple utilizes a consensus ledger that reduces network latency and computer power usage. Whereas Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, Ripple is its own transaction network with its own digital currency known as ripples, or XRP. Ripple seems to appeal more to large business developers over individual consumers.<\/p>\n<p>These are just a few examples of other cryptocurrencies. There are many more that possess distinctive<br \/>\nfeatures and technical specs. Finding the right cryptocurrency involves pinpointing what your needs are, but in any case, there are plenty to choose from.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Cryptocurrencies have blown up in terms of popularity, usability and value.
