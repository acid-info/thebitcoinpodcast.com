I became the &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m only investing what I&#8217;m willing to lose<\/em>&#8221; guy. \u00a0I became the &#8220;<em>I&#8217;m just on a crazy monetary roller coaster<\/em>&#8221; guy. \u00a0I solidified my &#8220;I&#8217;m going to be rich&#8221; emotions and committed to the long play. \u00a0This evolution was taking place during the first two quarters of 2014. \u00a0Say it with me now&#8230;&#8221;<em>Fuck Mark Karpeles!<\/em>&#8221; Well, we all know how that story played out, so I had to adapt, I had to evolve&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>3| HOW DOES THIS WORK?!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>As an educator I am well tuned to apt for reaching understanding and presenting my acquired knowledge. Think of me as a human size sponge with maximum absorbance. \u00a0And, then I squeeze out that knowledge into peoples&#8217; buckets. \u00a0Reusable, recyclable, re&#8211;I think you get the analogy. \u00a0At this stage of adaption, I was mutating, the beginning stages of a bitcoin evangelist. \u00a0What a viral stage of mutation?!?! Looking to touch people and have them become just like me. \u00a0Kind of like the antagonist of the film, &#8220;The Thing.&#8221; \u00a0Just transforming everyone into a bitcoin zealot. \u00a0It was a nasty mutation. And, just like the film, I am sure people wished to set me on fire and assure there was nothing of me left to transmit to the rest of the population.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>It wasn&#8217;t my fault I was entranced with the inner workings of bitcoin: blocks, blocksize, blockchains, sidechains, lightning in a network, \u00a0banks on banks on banks, YouTube videos, awkward family dinners&#8230;oh yeah, I was in it.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>And, everyone was going to know how bitcoin works! \u00a0Well, we all know how that story played out, so I had to adapt, I had to evolve&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>4| \u00a0SILENT BITCOIN SAMURAI!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This evolution has been the best. \u00a0I got my Samurai Jack on. \u00a0Silently sharpening my knowledge and practicing my pitch techniques. \u00a0If the pitchee is blocking low with a standard, &#8220;<em>Bitcoin is drug money<\/em>,&#8221; then I give them a high to mid vertical strike, &#8220;<em>It&#8217;s funny you mention drug money because when&#8217;s the last time you swiped your mastercard for Mary Jane&#8230;oh that&#8217;s right you used good ole fashioned United States Dollars, didn&#8217;t you?<\/em>&#8221; If my pitchee blocked high and right, &#8220;<em>Bitcoin is never going to surmount the regulatory hurdles,<\/em>&#8221; I would sweep strike low and left, &#8220;Actually there is a boiling regulatory push to accept bitcoin as not only a disruptive technology but also a dignifying currency. \u00a0It is only going to take one big thumbs up to solidify its legitimacy.&#8221; \u00a0We all know the sweep is the hardest to block, so we know how that story played out, so I had to adapt, I had to evolve&#8230;<\/p>\n<p><strong>5| LEADER BY EXAMPLE!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>I haven&#8217;t even reached my final form! \u00a0I like where I am now. \u00a0My friends and I started this show, built this site, and we are working daily on being a reliable cornerstone for the community. \u00a0The on-ramp cornerstone, the one where you can point your friends and family to so that they can see that bitcoin isn&#8217;t drug money, it is money. \u00a0Used by normal people to do normal things, that have grown weary of the business as usual that their government continues to practice. \u00a0The same business as usual that robs the elderly of their life&#8217;s wealth and perpetually rockets us to a debt driven society where its constituents are fiscal slaves to the system. \u00a0Constituents that are so busy fighting their debt that they cannot see the marionette puppeteers leeching them of their wealth. \u00a0Corey, Marcello, and myself are providing the public with the service of making bitcoin approachable , fun, and adoptable. \u00a0After all, adoption is the only thing that matters. \u00a0Giving people a chance that are so far down the totem pole they don&#8217;t know there is a totem pole. \u00a0I was taught a long time ago, &#8220;<em>If you reach the top of any mountain it is your duty to go back down and show everyone the path you took so you don&#8217;t get lonely up there.<\/em>&#8221; \u00a0When bitcoin reaches the top, I&#8217;ll be ready to pave a pathway. . \u00a0We don&#8217;t know how this story plays out, so next time I adapt, next time I evolve my &#8220;Why Bitcoin&#8230;&#8221; it is going to be from a place of bettering humanity&#8230;uprooting entrenched systems&#8230;spreading wealth to the ones that need it.<\/p>\n<p><strong>6| MONEY AIN&#8217;T A THING!<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8230;still adapting&#8230;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>To follow is a candid explanation of my personal evolution in the bitcoin space. \u00a0Maybe some of you will relate to my story.
