Cello bring up the fact that when you talk about &#8216;normies&#8217; you just further isolate your cause. Most people are &#8216;General Purpose People (GPP&#8217;s)&#8217; and they are not using crypto because it is inconvenient and pointless. So, here we are at the 10 year mark. Are you satisfied with it&#8217;s progress? If you want crypto to be mass adopted, then you better listen to what all those &#8216;normies&#8217; are saying and stop acting like a fringe club for anarchists. We look at this debate from many different viewpoints and open up the call lines for our fans to call in to join the discussion!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This week we get into a topical debate on adoption.
