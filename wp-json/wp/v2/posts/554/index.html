Enter, Jessi Baker, the founder of <a href=\"https:\/\/www.provenance.org\/\" target=\"_blank\">Provenance<\/a>, which is building on the blockchain that presents a paradigm shift for business and society: from one where you need to generate trust in your brand and product, to one where trust can be implicit.

This week we get her on the show to chat about the importance of supply chain transparency (and how a data solution could help solve it) and the implications of blockchain technology.

This is a leap forward that enables businesses to harness technology to prove the attributes that make their materials, ingredients and finished products great.<\/p>\n<blockquote>\n<h2 class=\"Features-title Features-title--greyDarker Features-title--italic\">&#8220;<em>To see how something is made, and the hands it\u2019s travelled through, is to understand\u00a0its\u00a0value.<\/em>&#8220;<\/h2>\n<\/blockquote>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Jessi Baker Every day we buy products that impact our planet.
