Their social travel ecosystem has acquired users across 5 continents in several major cities including London, New York, Seoul and Tokyo. Think of them as the decentralised Airbnb, whose ecosystem is made up of Pally Social \u2013 a mobile application that is currently available in beta from the Apple App Store, and Pally Adventures, a community marketplace where visitors can immerse themselves in new cities through experiences hosted by locals.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2477\" src=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1245\" height=\"371\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1.png 1245w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1-300x89.png 300w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1-768x229.png 768w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1-1024x305.png 1024w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1-450x134.png 450w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/image1-610x182.png 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1245px) 100vw, 1245px\" \/><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To facilitate peer-to-peer transactions in the Pally ecosystem, Pally is issuing PallyCoin (PAL), a community token, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">which will be built to run on the Ethereum blockchain, with ERC20 standard specifications, <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">allowing the community to earn and exchange PallyCoins by connecting, chatting and meeting up with each other.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By 2020, there will be 370 million travelling Millennials worldwide, who, until the inception of Pally, had extremely limited access to city experience marketplaces with an offering of affordable, high quality activities curated by locals. Moreover, those aged between 15 and 29 will be taking 47% more international trips by 2020 than in 2013. This is where Pally comes in &#8211; with a platform that provides travellers with access to friendly local people, and curated city experiences. In facilitating better travel experiences, Pally also enables its community to generate an extra income from their passions. <\/span><\/p>\n<hr \/>\n<p><b>About Pally<\/b><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Pally is a decentralised community that enables its members to have authentic travel experiences.
