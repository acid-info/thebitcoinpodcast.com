We are attempting to provide you with details and information from the people who are creating projects, and we are not giving advice. Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Kat Kuzmeskas from SimplyVital Health. SimplyVital Health is powered by Health Nexus, its blockchain ecosystem. In an effort to improve the switch to value-based care, it effectively makes use of blockchain to connect providers regardless of their clinical affiliation. The startup\u2019s ConnectingCare tool also harnesses blockchain to track clients\u2019 financials, monitor analytics and maintain static records generating information about our surroundings and behaviour.<\/p>\n<p>**Health Nexus is a blockchain-oriented distributed system handling data transfer,<br \/>\npayments, and storage specifically designed for Health Care. Because of the sensitive nature and requirements of healthcare, existing blockchain distributed systems are not adequate for healthcare. The goal of Health Nexus is to create a blockchain system that can pass the stringent requirements of healthcare by ensuring better data integrity, encryption, and by providing a validation system to ensure the miners running this network are compliant entities. Health Nexus uses a Distributed Hash Table combined with an Ethereum base Blockchain to provide, among many other features, an ability for frictionless data sharing and access to new revenue streams. This is accomplished via an upgrade to data integrity and security system and the addition of an executive governance system for node validation.<\/p>\n<p><strong>This excerpt is from the whitepaper which can be found on the token sale link.<br \/>\n*<\/strong>Special candid podcasting moment in this announcment.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Links:<br \/>\n\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.simplyvitalhealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https:\/\/www.simplyvitalhealth.com<\/a><br \/>\n\u2013\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/tokensale.simplyvitalhealth.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer nofollow noopener\">https:\/\/tokensale.simplyvitalhealth.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Kat Kuzmeskas Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Dee, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
