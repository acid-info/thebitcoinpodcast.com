There are still spots available. However, \u201cEarly Adopter\u201d registration closed at the end of October and tickets are selling out much faster than conference organizers had originally planned.<\/p>\n<p>The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference is organized by Richard Jacobs, publisher of the Future Tech Podcast and co-founder of Blockchain Edge, a consultancy firm that helps blockchain entrepreneurs turn their ideas into sustainable revenue models. Confirmed speakers include Tim Draper, the Billionaire venture capitalist, Erik Voorhees, who was featured in the Netflix documentary <em>Banking on Bitcoin<\/em>, Charlie Shrem, founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, and more than fifty other thought leaders and respected players in the cryptocurrency space.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cI think \u2018Bitcoin mania\u2019 has caught all of us off-guard\u201d, said Mr. Jacobs. \u201cEven though the Super Conference is almost four months away, more than half of the spots have been taken. And at the rate they are disappearing, I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if all the remaining tickets are gone by New Year\u2019s.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>The Super Conference covers three days. In addition to the main conference itself, there is also an additional \u201cbeginners track\u201d for those who are new to cryptocurrency to get up to speed quickly on how the industry works. There will also be a complimentary hackathon for kids, teens, and young adults, providing them with the perfect opportunity to get their hands dirty with blockchain technology.<\/p>\n<p>The main conference will feature more than 45 headline speakers, whose talks will all converge around the following theme: how can regular, Average-Joe investors get in on this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity and reap outlandish profits when blockchain technology enters the mainstream in 2018?<\/p>\n<p>Registration for the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference is still open. However, those who interested in attending are advised to register as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Ready to reserve your spot?
