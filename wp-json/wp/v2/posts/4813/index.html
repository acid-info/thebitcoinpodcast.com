Blockchain technology holds incredible promise for the financial industry. For the first time it\u2019s now possible to create real-time, highly robust transfer and settlement systems that current services simply cannot compete with. The securities industry is, like the banking industry, filled with centralized intermediaries that clear and settle transactions, handle shareholder communications, and other labor-intensive work. These expensive tasks can now be replaced with peer-to-peer technologies that bring the costs of performing this work down dramatically. That&#8217;s right, people! Issuing companies, dealers, and investors will all benefit significantly from cutting away this part of their overhead. We dive into all this and more!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Chris Horlacher &amp; Christian Saucier It has been YEARS since we last spoke to these two and we thought it was time for an update from the Equibit Group.
