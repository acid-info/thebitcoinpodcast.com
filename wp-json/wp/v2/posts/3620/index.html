Did we think the conference had value? Was it at least fun? Cello met Michael Bisping! We also worked though, don&#8217;t worry. We give our thoughts and invite <a href=\"https:\/\/mimirblockchain.solutions\/#\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">MIMIR Blockchain Solutions<\/a> to swing by and chat with us and southern hip-hop legend Boosie Badazz is dipping his toe in the crypto game. He stops by to tell us what he&#8217;s up to this year.<\/p>\n<p>So let&#8217;s expand on that a bit before you dive in. This episode will explain how Mimir incentivizes people to join the network and how that, in turn, allows for more secure transfers of information between nodes and mobile devices. By allowing users and developers to bypass the process of setting up their own nodes and syncing them to the blockchain, it reduces the time necessary to scale projects. But that\u2019s not all: the more people that join the network, the more nodes, and as the number of nodes increase, so too does the level of security in the system. It\u2019s the first of its kind, and it\u2019s already generating a good deal of interest.
