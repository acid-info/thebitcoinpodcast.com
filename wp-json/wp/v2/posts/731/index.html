Private currencies have existed before, and they can most certainly exist again. \u00a0Bitcoin is the reemergence of the private money. \u00a0A hedge against politicians and regulators regulating their constituents into autonomous servitude. \u00a0Politicians and regulators \u00a0may do a lot of awesome sometimes but given enough time, they begin to think that all that awesome they do is unquestionable and unchallengeable. \u00a0Bitcoin serves a purpose to remind them, \u201c<em>Hey, you work for us, not the other way around<\/em>.\u201d<\/p>\n<p>Mr. Dimon, you run a bank.
