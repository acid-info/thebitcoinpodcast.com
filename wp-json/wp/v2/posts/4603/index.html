Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Eric Jiang of FansTime.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Time Exchange-<\/strong><br \/>\nAs the number of users increasing and the depth of user engagement enhancing,there will be a huge amount of demand for individual IPs. So FansTime will launch an equivalent object as Exclusive Token in order to simplify the process of issuing and auditing. Time,the equivalent object,provides a more flexible assetization channel which can attract much more Individual IPs with potentials.Time Exchange will work with Exclusive Token Exchange in parallel, thus enriching the value system.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Fans Rights Mall-<\/strong><br \/>\nIt is one of the terminal consumption applications in FansTime ecosystem. With the development of the community, terminal consumption scenarios will increase greatly. Commodities in Fans Rights Mall covers traditional copyright commodities, tickets for offline activities , weaker-copyright digital contents. According to different status of Individual IPs, the commodities can be priced by IFS, Exclusive Token or Time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Exclusive Token Exchange-<\/strong><br \/>\nWith the Smart Contract of the FansTime parent Chain (iFans Chain), Individual IP can issue its own Exclusive Token, which is used to anchor its own IP value. Fans can obtain investment returns by holding and selling the Exclusive Token of Individual IP, directly participating in the process of Individual IP increasing. In this case, problems of pricing, transaction and assetization can be solved. FansTime will introduce high quality Individual IPs and more demand of segment markets into the community as to expand the scope of Exclusive Token using.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.fanstime.org\/english.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.fanstime.org\/english.html<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Eric Jiang, Founder Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
