The reason this argument is nonsense is because tools are morally agnostic, yes&#8230;tools. \u00a0Inanimate objects are morally agnostic. \u00a0For instance, society does not blame the hammer for bludgeoning someone, it blames the person who swung the hammer. \u00a0Conversely, society does not praise the hammer for crafting a beautiful home, it praises the craftsman. \u00a0Bitcoin, just like the hammer, is a tool. \u00a0A financial instrument, as well as a brilliant and paradigm shattering computer science \u00a0advancement. \u00a0A tool with the power to restore the tangible wealth within a unit of exchange.<\/p>\n<p>In my experience, there is never going to be a better existence between good and evil than a 50\/50 shared world. \u00a0There will always be an equally good amount of people as there are bad. \u00a0My challenge to us, the bitcoin community, is to be the good \u00a0half of the split:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Plan local meetups<\/li>\n<li>Identify scams<\/li>\n<li>Learn through teaching<\/li>\n<li>Build inclusion-centric apps<\/li>\n<li>Donate to great causes<\/li>\n<li>Promote great causes that accept bitcoin donations<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>There are many ways to use this new and amazing instrument that Satoshi graciously opened up to the world. \u00a0Don&#8217;t be a jabroni (jah-bro-knee) and seek out the evil half of the split.<\/p>\n<p>Bitcoin is simply a tool, and that makes it morally agnostic.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This blurb is simple Bitcoin is morally agnostic.
