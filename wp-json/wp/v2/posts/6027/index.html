They\u2019re working on the testing and implementation of cryptographically assured blockchain-based protocols; all built with their in-house designed open source testing suite. Their tools allow blockchain architects and developers the means to test their public chains in a more stringent real-world like environment so you they can quantify the fault tolerance, latency, and stability of p2p blockchain systems more easily. This allows for improved sustainable data availability for public chains, and a more mature methodology for testing chains at scale. We also have some discussions around ETH 2.0, and Zak\u2019s experiences building in a chain agnostic manner.<\/p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Show Link(s):<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/whiteblock.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">WhiteBlock<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.the-paper-trail.org\/post\/2008-08-13-a-brief-tour-of-flp-impossibility\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">FLP Impossibility<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Intro\/Outro Music \u201cMotivation\u201d by Alec King:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/alecking13\/motivation\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">SoundCloud<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Show Sponsor(s):<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/amentum.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">Amentum<\/a><\/p>\n<p dir=\"auto\"><strong>Disclaimer: This is not investment advice, it is an engaged discussion on new technology; BlockChannel reminds you to always do your own due diligence before investing in any crypto-related project in the industry.<\/strong><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>On this episode of BlockChannel, McKie and Dr. Petty sit down with Zak Cole, CEO and blockchain-literate extraordinaire of WhiteBlock.
