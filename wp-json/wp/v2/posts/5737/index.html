The three amigos of Crypto (minus Dee) are joined by Ray Redacted. When Ray stops by the show he always brings in tow a mountain of information about any new security breaches, any new security tips, any new cryptocurrency best practices. Today, he discusses the origins of why bitcoin was invented and what it is good for to this day. This gets spun into a deeper discussion about the &#8216;whys&#8217; around why other of these blockchain technologies are being built. Corey went to a log cabin and listened to a podcast, because that&#8217;s what&#8217;s hot in the streets. And, Cello&#8217;s office is the Nebuchadnezzar.<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<div class=\"window-module u-clearfix js-custom-fields-section\">\n<div class=\"window-module-title window-module-title-no-divider\">\n<h3 class=\"u-inline-block\"><\/h3>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<p><strong>Donate<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>https:\/\/the-bitcoin-podcast.github.io\/<\/p>\n<\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This episode of TBP is best listened to in a dorm room at 3AM with your buddies and some edible snacks.
