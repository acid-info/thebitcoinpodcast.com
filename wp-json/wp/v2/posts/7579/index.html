In addition, in a few days we\u2019ll be in DC to celebrate Equibit and the opening date of their official ICO! Matt McKibbin swings by the show to talk a bit about it. If you want to participate sign up here \u2013 https:\/\/ico.equibit.org\/<\/p>\n<p>EDC is building Equibit, the world\u2019s first peer-to-peer equity marketplace and a complete platform for issuers to manage their investor relations without the need for depositories and transfer agents. Equibit allows issuers to use cryptocurrency tokens, called \u2018equibits\u2019, to authorize and disseminate their shares. It also includes a secure, P2P communications system allowing for private messages and polls to be instantly sent to individuals and groups on the network. It is important to invest on things that will give back to you, one of the best recommendations I give is to find a good insurance company such as One Sure Insurance to always get full cover.<\/p>\n<p>Andreas Antonopoulos<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Website:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/aantonop.com\/\">https:\/\/aantonop.com\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Twitter:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/aantonop\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/aantonop<\/a><\/li>\n<li>YouTube:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/aantonop\">https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/aantonop<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Patreon:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/bePatron?u=3268173\">https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/bePatron?u=3268173<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Telegram:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/web.telegram.org\/z\/\">https:\/\/web.telegram.org\/z\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Amazon:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/-\/e\/B00MVAG8Z8\">https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/-\/e\/B00MVAG8Z8<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The Bitcoin Podcast Social Media<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https:\/\/join.slack.com\/t\/thebitcoinpodcast\/shared_invite\/zt-exkyyos5-z27SkrXur0aI94fa3kADTQ\">Join-Slack<\/a>:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/launchpass.com\/thebitcoinpodcast\">https:\/\/launchpass.com\/thebitcoinpodcast<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Patreon:<a href=\"https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/TheBitcoinPodcastNetwork\">https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/TheBitcoinPodcastNetwork<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Website:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/\">https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/<\/a><\/li>\n<li>Twitter:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/thebtcpodcast\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/thebtcpodcast<\/a><\/li>\n<li>DADDAO:\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/daddao.org\/\">https:\/\/daddao.org\/<\/a><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>This is a Flashback Episode, we are going back to Jan 2017 in which Andreas Antonopoulosgreets us at the beginning of the bull run of 2017 on his second appearance on\u00a0 The Bitcoin Podcast Network.\u00a0 When I dove down the rabbit hole of Bitcoin in late 2013, Andreas\u2019 YouTube talks and podcasts pulled me further [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":7,"featured_media":7580,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","unlock_protocol_post_locks":"","publish_to_discourse":"0","publish_post_category":"1","wpdc_auto_publish_overridden":"1","wpdc_topic_tags":"","wpdc_pin_topic":"","wpdc_pin_until":"","discourse_post_id":"","discourse_permalink":"","wpdc_publishing_response":"","wpdc_publishing_error":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[1,2],"tags":[11,1426,1429,1415,1425,1428,1420,1423,1459,1422,454,970,1421,1413,1424,1418,1416,1419,1541,1427,1414,1417],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7579"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/7"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=7579"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7579\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":7584,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/7579\/revisions\/7584"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/7580"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=7579"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=7579"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=7579"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
