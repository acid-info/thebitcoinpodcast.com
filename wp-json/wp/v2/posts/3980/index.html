But, one thing is for sure, if you\u2019re familiar with the cryptocurrency space at all, you\u2019ve probably heard of Roger Ver. He was an early proponent of digital currencies who loudly espoused the virtues of Bitcoin back when each unit cost just a few dollars. Sure, Roger Ver is, without doubt, one of the most controversial people within the Crypto community. But his insight is valuable and since his appearance on our podcast back in 2016, a lot has changed. His fork of Bitcoin, use of the Bitcoin.com domain and his stock answers about honoring the original Satoshi White Paper have rightfully opened him up to questioning.
