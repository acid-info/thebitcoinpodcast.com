Milestone! This week we chat about Segwit and the ongoing story&nbsp;that the U.S. government filed a civil petition yesterday in federal court seeking disclosure of all Coinbase U.S. customers&#8217; records over a three year period. What does this mean for you? Also, joining us in the studio is porn legend <a href=\"http:\/\/kenicamz.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Keni Styles<\/a>! Be careful Googling the name, you&#146;ll get an eyeful. When asked what got him into bitcoin, Keni releases a deeply personal story. During this interview we are blessed with a tell-all story about Keni&#146;s &#8216;aha&#8217; moment with bitcoin. Using his past experiences with extremely risky schemes and investments, he could clearly see the difference between those and bitcoin. This interview shines a light onto how, like porn, or anything else fringe, bitcoin has shady people involved who ruin it&#146;s reputation, which cripples mass adoption. This episode will give you the most unique perspective into the financial struggles of being unbanked in the digital era.<\/p>\n<p><strong>End song credit:<\/strong>&nbsp;https:\/\/soundcloud.com\/sodaisland\/grynpyret-boba-beach<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Keni Styles 100 episodes. 100 EPISODES!
