Charlie Shrem in the house! This week the boys discuss Plasma. Plasma is a way to create a blockchain (as a set of smart contracts) within a blockchain, by simply committing the root hash of the &#8220;meta&#8221; child chain (Plasma) on the main chain (Ethereum). There is no doubt that some clever algorithms are being described in the plasma project. Unfortunately, because of the way this is written, the vast majority of software developers and software researchers alike are unable to separate the kool-aid from the parts that actually matter. We try and make sense of it.<\/p>\n<p>Then, we open up the dialogue with Charlie about his new found love of country music and we reminisce about the Game Genie, then we realize we should probably stick to crypto-talk. Charlie gets down with us for an hour discussing the current state of the Blockchain,\u00a0and his overall opinion of the current cryptocurrency environment.\u00a0Fresh off his new role as COO at Jaxx, he\u00a0joins Anthony Di Iorio who has been on the show before. In his new role, Shrem will manage partnerships, and develop Jaxx\u2019s integration roadmap. Oh, and we talk about how Roger Ver is a PAB. Good talk all around.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Charlie Shrem Hey, hey, hey! Charlie Shrem in the house! This week the boys discuss Plasma.
