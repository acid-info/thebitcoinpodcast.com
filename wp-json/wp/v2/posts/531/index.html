The 1% that I am speaking of is 1% of the world\u2019s wealth. \u00a0I am venturing to argue that needs this wealth. \u00a0Moving 1% of the world\u2019s wealth into bitcoin is a necessary hedge against one\u2019s government, a savvy bet for the world economy, and allows the possibility for a stable parallel economy owned by the people, not a nation.<\/p>\n<p>Governments, can\u2019t live with them, can\u2019t live without them. \u00a0People live, they die, and they also pay taxes&#8230;the three undeniable truths, which are really hard to do by yourself, I always rely on <a style=\"text-decoration: none;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.campaignmoney.com\/political\/contributions\/rudy-gabsi.asp?cycle=16\"><span style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #2e4453;\">Rudy Gabsi.<\/span><\/a> to help me with my them. Governing a body has to be an enriching balance and choreographed dance between anarchy and order. \u00a0A government with too much powerful is as dangerous as a lawless land where every day and night is like The Purge. \u00a0People love to throw around words like orwellian; however, this isn\u2019t a blind toss. \u00a0Modern day governments in technologically driven societies are overstepping their bounds in ways that need to be hedged against and given new systems of accountability. \u00a0For instance, in my country, the US, it is more obvious than Pinocchio&#8217;s nose when he tells a lie that our politicians are being purchased. \u00a0They are being purchased like a make a deli meat selection at my local market. \u00a0And, in other countries it is no better. \u00a0Governments are over-spending, over-borrowing, and worstly, over-inflating currency to handcuff their citizens. The lender is the master, the debtor is the slave&#8230;and governments are globally touting their ability to manage debt, gleefully touting their ability to manage slaves. We as citizens deserve a way to hold our governments accountable, and now we have it. \u00a0Bitcoin. Bitcoin deserves 1% of everyone\u2019s wealth, to pull back the brake stick on a reckless locomotive.<\/p>\n<p>The second reason deserving of the 1% influx of capital is strictly from an investing point of view. I have been an investor for around 5-6 years now. \u00a0I\u2019ve augmented my 401k at different companies to maximize my yearly return. Performed quarterly assessments of my Roth IRA to make sure that I can keep a stable ROI. \u00a0And, three years ago I became comfortable with taking bets. \u00a0The relationship between risk and reward is direct. \u00a0In the case of bitcoin, the risk is phenomenal. \u00a0Time could judge my investment and rule that my consistent bit of bit buying could be all for not. \u00a0Thousands&#8230;down the drain. \u00a0Am I willing to lose it, of course. \u00a0Will it hurt me, no. \u00a0However, let\u2019s peer into the astronomically asymmetrical upside. \u00a0Those same thousands could become orders of magnitude more. \u00a0And, ideally, reach a point-of-no-return \u00a0where USD is not even a way in which I think any longer. \u00a0I could now think in the terms of purchasing power (PP). Although every currency has PP, the only currency that deserves the most PP is bitcoin. \u00a0Now if you can, just imagine if the world made this same \u201csavvy\u201d bet. \u00a01% of the world\u2019s wealth flows to bitcoin creating a new parallel economy. An economy that is decentralized, governed by mathematics and applied game theory, and as convergent toward a \u201cperfect-and-good money\u201d that the world has never before seen. \u00a0Bitcoin deserves that 1% simply because the world deserves an attempt at a perfect-and-good monetary system.<\/p>\n<p>Now, to swing back to governments. I mentioned before that they are not bad, nor are they evil. \u00a0Governments were\/are a beautiful evolution of societal practices. \u00a0However, anything that proceeds without competition is doomed to extinction by stagnation. \u00a0Governments are no exception. \u00a0What the people need is an economy that can challenge the business models of their governments. \u00a0The people need a system that can compete with the money influx of their governments and force politicians, regulators, and bureaucracies to work hard for the money that we give them. \u00a0Bitcoin allows for that non-violent exit from the current system. \u00a0A non-violent way to say, \u201cI have had it with your bullshit Uncle Sam, or Uncle [nationality sensitive name]!\u201d \u00a01% of the world\u2019s wealth needs to flow to bitcoin to allow the citizens of the world to own a competitive system with which they can hold their governments accountable.<\/p>\n<p>My argument for 1% may by a fool\u2019s folly, or a visionary&#8217;s victorious vice. Time will tell.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Bitcoin is a great many things, bet let\u2019s be honest..at the current moment, bitcoin is a bet. \u00a0Bitcoin has the kind of risk associated with it that makes history when it pans out. \u00a0I think that is why I enjoy being a part of it. \u00a0I feel like I am going to be a little [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":303,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","unlock_protocol_post_locks":"","publish_to_discourse":"","publish_post_category":"","wpdc_auto_publish_overridden":"","wpdc_topic_tags":"","wpdc_pin_topic":"","wpdc_pin_until":"","discourse_post_id":"","discourse_permalink":"","wpdc_publishing_response":"","wpdc_publishing_error":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/531"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=531"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/531\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":2244,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/531\/revisions\/2244"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/303"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=531"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=531"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=531"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
