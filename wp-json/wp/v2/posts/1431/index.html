If you fall into this category, (don\u2019t feel bad, you\u2019re in good company), this episode is here to let you know that there\u2019s a potential for blockchain and its enabling capabilities to solve core problems in healthcare. Healthcare is at a tipping point.\u00a0You have a one in five chance of re-entering a hospital within 30 days, so the industry is spending on new technology but not making the care any better.

Too many hurdles limit access, data remains elusive and sharing has become too cumbersome. This is the interoperability problem, and Redox solves it. They are the bridge from health systems to the cloud and back \u2014 interoperability is now open.\u00a0Both of our thumbs are way up.<\/p>\n<p>Here are some of the gifs we talked about in the episode.
