The concept behind the app works by automatically investing a users spare change into the cryptocurrency market. If you spent $9.50 somewhere, the app will automatically round up to the nearest dollar, investing $0.50 into your crypto portfolio in the app, which currently features Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin. This is definitely an entrepreneurial focused show.
