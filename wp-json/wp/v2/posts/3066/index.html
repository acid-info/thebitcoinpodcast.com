How does that relate to crypto?<\/p>\n<p>Well a major talking point is although USA alone has trillions USD of debt, we all know that the debts will never be paid off. This fraudulent debt situation is valid for all nations worldwide. Fact is that the true USD cash in circulation worldwide is around 1.580 Billion USD. Bitcoin is not a debt based currency, with this fact of approaching 10% of circulating USD, Bitcoin Eco System is becoming superior in Reality, in Cash! Are we freaking awesome together or what?<\/p>\n<p>I expect Bitcoin will overthrow the total circulating USD very very soon. What do you think? How about Ethereum? ROCKET SHIP! You see the price?! That&#8217;s a 5,500% price rise compared to current price. The price of Ethereum may be rising on the news that Ethereum might get its own derivatives market, as well as prediction by Bitcoin investor Mike Novogratz that the price of ether will reach\u00a0<b>$500\u00a0<\/b>this year.
