Of course not. You do not attack the concept\/idea of cash if a drug dealer doesn\u2019t accept credit card payments. \u00a0That\u2019s ridiculous, right? \u00a0Why does anyone with nefarious motives use cash? \u00a0Well, it turns out that cold hard cash has a lot of favorable attributes for someone who wants to stay under the radar. \u00a0For instance, it is difficult to trace, it is instantaneous, there are no charge backs, and it is universally accepted. \u00a0You get the idea, and you probably already knew all this. What\u2019s the problem with traditional cash?<\/p>\n<p>You can\u2019t throw it at your computer screen to pay for things far away.<\/p>\n<p>That won\u2019t get you anywhere. \u00a0In fact, up until now, it was quite difficult to transact digitally without leaving a trail for all to see. \u00a0You have been forced to trust services to take your cash and transact for you, keeping records of your business. \u00a0Over time, as technology has grown, we can now share information at incredible velocity via the internet. \u00a0Subsequently, the financial systems have attempted to keep up, building things that allow you to make purchases across far distances, but they are based on their own antiquated infrastructure&#8211;basically, traditional cash transfer. \u00a0If you want to use these systems, then they need to know who you are, and what you want to do.<\/p>\n<p>Until now. \u00a0This is what the \u201cdecentralized\u201d notion is all about when people try to tell you about Bitcoin. \u00a0There is no \u201cthey.\u201d \u00a0When you hand cash to someone for something, you don\u2019t rely on a company to take your money, and then hand it the person in front of you. \u00a0You can do that yourself. \u00a0Bitcoin is the same, but digitally. \u00a0This is fundamentally different than all other ways to pay for things on the internet. \u00a0Bitcoin is digital cash, and nothing else is.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-613\" src=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/doubleedgeheader.jpg\" alt=\"doubleedgeheader\" width=\"600\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/doubleedgeheader.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/doubleedgeheader-300x180.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2015\/12\/doubleedgeheader-450x270.jpg 450w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" \/><\/p>\n<p>So if you\u2019ve followed me up to this point, then it isn\u2019t that hard to make the next logical step. \u00a0You cannot attack Bitcoin because people use it for nefarious activities for the same reasons you can\u2019t attack physical cash&#8211;they&#8217;re identical. \u00a0Well\u2026 Bitcoin is actually better because the blockchain is an open ledger for all to see, but that\u2019s for another blog (or google it). \u00a0Bitcoin is a tool, which solves the same human-problem that cash does, but does it wwwaaaaayyyyy better. \u00a0It is a technology that expands the possibilities of transferring things of value far beyond our current systems. \u00a0Naturally, after its invention, people will find new ways to do things. \u00a0Some of those things will be bad, some will be good.<\/p>\n<p>As always, let\u2019s use the internet as an example. \u00a0The internet was invented, it spread, people use it. \u00a0I think everyone can agree on this. \u00a0Bad people do things, and then share these wrong-doings on the internet for others to see, pirate, purchase, etc. \u00a0Do we blame the internet for enabling the wrong-doers? \u00a0Do we boycott its use because \u201c<em>bad people use the internet?<\/em>\u201d \u00a0No, that\u2019s ridiculous. \u00a0The internet was an expanding technology that allowed people to share information almost instantaneously, and we cannot condemn it because there are a few bad apples in the tree who want to do shitty things.<\/p>\n<p>I think I can sum this entire post up. \u00a0Sorry for making you read everything else. \u00a0Every community has assholes, but you can\u2019t judge the entire community based on the actions of the assholes alone. \u00a0More specifically, you really shouldn\u2019t blame the tool the assholes are using.<\/p>\n<p>Stop blaming Bitcoin for the actions of humanity\u2019s assholes.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Would you be surprised to find out that a drug dealer does not accept credit card payments?
