We are attempting to provide you with details and information from the people who are creating projects, and we are not giving advice. Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Markus Levin from the XYO Network. The XYO Network, The World\u2019s First Location-based Decentralized Oracle. Since its founding in 2012, the company behind the XYO Network (XY OracleNetwork) has been steadily building a location network. The XYO Network makes it possible for smart contracts to plug into the real world by calling XY&#8217;s network of devices to determine if an object is at a specific XY-coordinate at a given time. If the object\u2019s location is confirmed, the smart contract is executed. The use-cases and profound impact of such a technology are infinite.<\/p>\n<p>With over 1 million location-verifying beacons already built, and hundreds of thousands ready to be enabled, blockchain&#8217;s first crypto-location oracle network has arrived. Our mission is to enable smart contracts to interact with the real world as if it were an API. Join us in decentralizing location-reliant trade markets.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/xyo.network\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/xyo.network\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Markus Levin, Co-Founder &amp; Head of Operations Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
