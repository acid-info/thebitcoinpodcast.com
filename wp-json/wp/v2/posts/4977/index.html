CyberMiles is building a blockchain platform targeted for e-commerce with those concerns in mind. Using a fork of Ethereum and the Ethereum toolsets, CyberMiles has an upgraded EVM with support for extended and extensible opcodes and a dPoS consensus system for validators to stake into the network. Their research is pushing the limits of what the existing technology can do, and they have some amazing progress in proving alternative systems for developing blockchain. Michael is a very exceptional scientists in this space, and he and Collin had a great conversation, not just about CyberMiles, but the space in general.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Links<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.cybermiles.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/www.cybermiles.io<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/github.com\/cybermiles\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/github.com\/cybermiles<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/juntao\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/juntao<\/a><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/medium.com\/@michaelyuan_88928\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/medium.com\/@michaelyuan_88928<\/a><\/p>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Michael Yuan On this episode, we have the extreme pleasure of interviewing Michael Yuan, Chief Scientist at CyberMiles.
