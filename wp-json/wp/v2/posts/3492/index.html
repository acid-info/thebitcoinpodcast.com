He\u2019s founded 20 companies including StockPickr, and he frequently contributes to TechCrunch, TheStreet, and the Financial Times. Now he\u2019s got his finger on Bitcoin\u2019s pulse, and you don\u2019t want to miss what he\u2019s going to reveal.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Tim Draper<\/strong> \u2013 Tim is a venture capitalist, and his firm was one of the early investors in Skype, has his fingers in a lot of pies, including crypto and blockchain ventures. He&#8217;s going to show you where the smart money is.<\/li>\n<li><strong>John McAfee<\/strong> \u2013 Yes, that McAfee. He\u2019s the guy who created McAfee internet security. He also famously said he\u2019d eat his you-know-what on live TV if Bitcoin didn\u2019t reach $500k in three years. John\u2019s going to show you why he\u2019s not nervous about that at all.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Ronnie Moas<\/strong> \u2013 Ronnie was a Wall Street money man, and he founded Standpoint Research. He and his team deliver stock analysis daily. When bitcoin was still a joke to most, Ronnie predicted it would hit $11k. Then $14k. Then $20k. Wait until you hear his next predictions.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Erik Voorhees<\/strong> \u2013 Erik co-founded the bitcoin company Coinapult and is also the creator and CEO of ShapeShift.io, the instant bitcoin and altcoin exchange. He\u2019s been a featured guest on Bloomberg, Fox Business, CNBC, BBC Radio, The Peter Schiff Show, and numerous industry conferences. Erik is no fan of the Feds or taxes and keeps his finances and assets in bitcoin.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Charlie Shrem<\/strong> \u2013 Charlie has been featured in two Bitcoin documentaries: \u201cThe Rise and Rise of Bitcoin,\u201d and \u201cBanking on Bitcoin\u201d and he has a lot to say about where the blockchain revolution is headed. Charlie is also the founder of the Bitcoin Foundation (Vice-Chairman 2012 to 2014) and worked on the standardization, protection, and promotion of Bitcoin.<\/li>\n<li><strong>Lyn Ulbricht<\/strong> \u2013 Lyn is the mother of Ross Ulbricht. Ross was handed a double life sentence for creating the Silk Road marketplace. The problem is, they were all non-violent charges, and no victims came forward in any way. By contrast, Noriega got 25 years. Having seen her only son incarcerated for life after a trial rife with proven corruption, Lyn is dedicated to fighting not only for Ross\u2019s freedom but for the thousands who have been victimized by our flawed criminal justice system and the drug war. She\u2019ll be talking about Digital Privacy.<\/li>\n<li>And more than 50 others who are <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitcoinsuperconference.com\/speakers\/\">detailed on the Super Conference confirmed speakers page<\/a>.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Tickets to the \u201cmain\u201d Super Conference have completely sold out.
