People are rarely motivated intrinsically, a majority of the time it is some sort of extrinsic motivation that causes that impulse for change. \u00a0So be difficult. \u00a0If your friends owe you some change or vice versa, then ask them to give it to you in bitcoin, or you pay them back in bitcoin. \u00a0Bitcoin requires a massive educational effort on all fronts from those that know to those that don&#8217;t. \u00a0And, everyone knows the old adage comparing catching a fish and teaching to fish. \u00a0Yes, teaching someone to fish is more difficult, for you and the person learning, but they aren&#8217;t going to learn a thing about fishing until you give them the pole and let them cast on their own. \u00a0That first time they cast out that lure it is a scary moment, you may even get caught in the hook, but there will be lessons learned. \u00a0\u00a0And, before you know it, fishing is a viable experience that you both can share, so be difficult.<\/p>\n<p>There is something that comes along with being difficult that I must warn you about, and that thing is fear. \u00a0Fear of rejection, fear of alienation, fear of being wrong, and a slew of others; but muster up your better you and put some courage in your satchel because none of those fears\u00a0are life \u00adthreatening, so get over yourself. \u00a0I have found that most times my genuine affinity for betterment supersedes my difficult nature, and the endless cultivation of dense relationships usually bears the fruit of a new bitcoiner every once in a while. \u00a0 And, to add on to that analogy,\u00a0is horticulture easy? \u00a0Find someone who grows their own produce and maintains their own sustenance and ask them how easy it is. \u00a0What you hear could most likely be summed up in one word, difficult.<\/p>\n<p>Hopefully this blurb inspires the few, because it is always the few that guide the many. \u00a0Go be difficult. \u00a0Go make bitcoin an experience for someone. \u00a0Go teach people how to fish by putting the pole in their hand.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Yo&#8230; My blogs are always going to be personal and produced from the kindle that is my experience as a bitcoiner. \u00a0And, as I write I imagine I am speaking with two sets of people: \u00a0those that understand bitcoin and are looking to read a fellow bitcoiner&#8217;s thought blurbs, or someone that\u00a0lacks understanding of this [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":303,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","unlock_protocol_post_locks":"","publish_to_discourse":"","publish_post_category":"","wpdc_auto_publish_overridden":"","wpdc_topic_tags":"","wpdc_pin_topic":"","wpdc_pin_until":"","discourse_post_id":"","discourse_permalink":"","wpdc_publishing_response":"","wpdc_publishing_error":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/352"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=352"}],"version-history":[{"count":3,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/352\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":413,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/352\/revisions\/413"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/303"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=352"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=352"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=352"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
