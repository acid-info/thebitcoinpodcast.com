Since we take nothing for granted, we took full advantage and picked Charlies brain about SegWit, the Token app, ICOs and much more. This is probably our most intellectual episode to date, you won\u2019t wanna miss this educational masterpeace.<\/p>\n<p>The level of intellect in this interview is stifling, but don\u2019t be intimidated. Join our slack chat if you have any questions and we will try our best to answer them all.<\/p>\n<p>Charlie explains why he fought so passionately to signal for SegWit and what he hopes it will bring to litecoin.
