It will also bring content producers and consumers closer together to give consumers greater access to content, when they want, how they want and at price points that are fair. Together, team Veredictum believe with this combination they can reduce film and video piracy by 80% over 10 years.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">Founder of Veredictum, Tim Lea, an MBA trained, finance professional, filmmaker and entrepreneur says the<\/span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Veredictum platform centres on targeting the drivers of piracy and theft rather than just its symptoms, using the strength and resolve of the creative community itself to help solve the problem.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\">\u201c<\/span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><em>Piracy is not just one person\u2019s problem; it&#8217;s everyone\u2019s<\/em>,\u201d says Lea. \u201c<em>Our objective is to galvanise\u00a0<\/em><\/span><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em>the creative community together to solve the biggest problem that is facing the community\u2019s very surviva<\/em>l\u201d, he adds.<\/span><\/span><\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">The community, and others who may wish to help, use their surplus bandwith and computing power to form a powerful global network of machines that perform decentralised global searches for registered content \u2013 whilst at the same time providing the infrastructure to enable enhanced video distribution services. This network has incentive structures built in.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family: Calibri;\"><span style=\"font-size: medium;\"><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">\u201c<em>Whilst there is a natural incentive for creatives to want to resolve the problem of piracy and theft, from a pragmatic point of view\u00a0<\/em><\/span><\/span><em><span lang=\"EN-AU\">we also need to economically incentivise the community to work with us. This could not be achieved using traditional financial systems \u2013 how could we hope to pay two cents to someone in a different country to share their surplus computing power or bandwidth?

The more registered content they locate and the more bandwith they provide to support enhanced distribution services, the more Ventana they can earn. After the Token Sale has completed, Ventana is expected to be able to be converted to Bitcoin within a couple of weeks of the Token Sale completing.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">\u201c<em>We are talking with a number of the cryptocurrency exchanges to accept Ventana. Once on the exchanges, Ventana will be able to be exchanged for Bitcoin, and then ultimately exchanged for local currencies. In this way, our community can either hold their Ventana, sell it for their local currency or use the currency to buy additional services currently being designed for the platform<\/em>.\u201d<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">Veredictum\u2019s ultimate objective is to provide the infrastructure that give consumers easier access to content. They will connect content producers directly to market influencers and their \u201c<em>tribes<\/em>\u201d, creating a marketplace where consumers collectively bid for the content they wish to view, with the Veredictum infrastructure distributing and protecting the content.<\/span><\/span><\/p>\n<p><span lang=\"EN-AU\"><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Calibri; font-size: medium;\">\u201c<em>Content producers will have a new wholesale channel that is market defined and performance oriented.
