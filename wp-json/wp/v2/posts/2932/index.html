(Worth watching, by the way, if you need a crash course on how cryptocurrency started and where it\u2019s all going.)<\/p>\n<p>Erik famously keeps all his assets and finances in bitcoin. (When he sold one of his companies, Satoshi Dice, back in 2013, the anonymous buyer paid in bitcoin. It was the world\u2019s first large corporate takeover executed through bitcoin.)<\/p>\n<p>He\u2019s literally \u201call-in\u201d with bitcoin. Why?<\/p>\n<p>Because Erik understands \u2013 better than most, because he\u2019s been involved in Bitcoin since almost the beginning and is one of the most respected players in the industry \u2013 that cryptocurrency is more than just an \u201cinnovation\u201d. It\u2019s a technological game-changer that, in Erik\u2019s words, will take our civilization out of the \u201ceconomic dark ages\u201d and solve a problem our ancestors have grappled with for millennia.<\/p>\n<p>This is why the rise of cryptocurrency is inevitable.<\/p>\n<p>And since its rise is inevitable, those who were smart enough to buy into Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) while it was on the ground floor have the opportunity of a lifetime to reap huge returns when the rest of the world wakes up to the opportunity too.<\/p>\n<p>This is why Erik and others like him are all-in with Bitcoin \u2013 because, they believe, it\u2019s the best bet we\u2019ll ever see in our lifetime, and the window for getting in before it gets hot is closing rapidly.<\/p>\n<p>Now, you might not want to go all-in on Bitcoin like Erik has \u2013 but I bet there\u2019s a part of you that wants to see what he sees and discover why he\u2019s so confident about the blockchain revolution, right?<\/p>\n<p>If so, there\u2019s a rare opportunity coming up to meet Erik Voorhees in person and listen to him speak. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference takes place in Dallas, Texas, from Friday February 16 th to Sunday February 18 th . Richard Jacobs, its organizer, is bringing together more than 39 of the most pre-eminent players in the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry \u2013 titans like Erik Voorhees, Charlie Shrem, Tim Draper, and many more \u2013 so they can show you where the industry is headed in 2018 and beyond, and where the biggest bucks will be made by investors.<\/p>\n<p>If you register before the \u201cEarly Adopter\u201d deadline, tickets cost just $597 (the full price is $797) \u2013 and you\u2019ll also get a complimentary conference t-shirt and entry into a cryptocurrency raffle.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Purchase conference tickets over here:<\/strong><br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitcoinsuperconference.com\/attendee-registration-page\/?utm_source=TheBitcoinPodcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https:\/\/www.bitcoinsuperconference.com\/attendee-registration-page\/?utm_source=TheBitcoinPodcast<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Or, if you want to learn more about the Super Conference and get free sneak preview content from some of the speakers, click the link below to sign up to the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bitcoinsuperconference.com\/notification-list\/?utm_source=TheBitcoinPodcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">free notification list<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p><strong>About the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>This three-day conference will be held at Dallas\/Fort Worth Airport Marriot North Hotel, February 16th to Sunday February 18th , 2018.
