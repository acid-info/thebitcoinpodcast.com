There needs to be an assumed level of trust. More critically, each message passing operation needs a human in the loop at the physical level because the user needs to physically scan the QRcode into a separate independent device where additional verification can be run. If you don&#8217;t trust your Internet connected phone, you can buy another phone that is always in Airplane mode and do the verification there. But who wants to do all that flibbity-floo?\u00a0The Trezor is cold storage. Keeping your private keys strictly offline used to require two computers until Trezor came along and made cold storage easy and affordable. But like Reading Rainbow, you don&#8217;t have to take our word for it. Joining us this week is\u00a0Alena Vranova, business developer, Co-founder of SatoshiLabs, and the creator of TREZOR. She chatted with us about\u00a0crypto, economy, security, questions of life, everything! It&#8217;s a good listen. You know what to do.<\/p>\n<p>For the price of only $99, this device is certainly a catch. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.buytrezor.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Get your Trezor device now<\/a>!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests:\u00a0Alena Vranova The question of &#8220;how to store your bitcoins&#8221; leads to one of the most important decisions for a Bitcoin user to make.
