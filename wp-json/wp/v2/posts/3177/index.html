When registration for the conference opened to the public in September, there were 500 spots; now, less than 100 remain.<\/p>\n<p>The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference is the brainchild of Richard Jacobs, host of the Future Tech Podcast and author of <em>Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain: Surprising Insights from 200+ Podcast Interviews of Industry Insiders<\/em>. Over the last two years, he has carefully curated a \u201cblack book\u201d of developers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists, and industry thought leaders who are working behind closed doors on more than a dozen technologies that are all capable of becoming the \u201cnext Bitcoin\u201d. The Super Conference is about bringing them together, so that the \u201clittle guy\u201d can get the full low-down from industry insiders \u2013 so they are in a position to follow the smart money in 2018.<\/p>\n<p>\u201cWhen we first planned this conference, cryptocurrency was something only a relatively small group of enthusiasts were talking about\u201d, said Mr. Jacobs. \u201cNow, everyone and their dog wants in on Bitcoin, and the \u2018Bitcoin mania\u2019 we\u2019re seeing is incredible. In just the last two weeks alone, we\u2019ve sold more than 300 conference tickets \u2013 and it looks like we\u2019ll be sold out before Christmas!\u201d<\/p>\n<p>What makes this three-day conference different from other blockchain gatherings?<\/p>\n<p>First \u2013 the line up of confirmed speakers, which include John McAfee, creator of McAfee (the world\u2019s first commercial antivirus software), Tim Draper, the Billionaire venture capitalist, Erik Voorhees, who was featured in the Netflix documentary Banking on Bitcoin, Charlie Shrem, founder of the Bitcoin Foundation, and dozens of other developers, entrepreneurs, venture capitalists \u2013 i.e. the very people behind the \u201cnext Bitcoin\u201d, as opposed to commentators and pundits.<\/p>\n<p>Second \u2013 as well as the main conference, there is also an optional \u201cbeginners track\u201d for people who are new to cryptocurrency, so they can get up to speed on the fundamentals of this unique industry.<\/p>\n<p>Third \u2013 there is also a complimentary \u201chackathon\u201d for kids, teenagers, and young adults. Several of our featured speakers, who are founders and advisors of actual blockchain startups, will put them into small teams and coach them through the process of designing and developing a working prototype.<\/p>\n<p>Registration for the Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Blockchain Super Conference is still open. However, those who interested in attending are advised to register as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.<\/p>\n<p>Ready to reserve your spot?
