Rappers and luxury cars? We thought crupto was about building things! Ah well. Our man Kenn Bosak exposes a scammer on the conference floor and gets kicked out! Also, we chat about\u00a0Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey reaffirming his bullish stance on Bitcoin and crypto as global payment. We tell him to put his money where his mouth is. In addition, for millions of people around the world, having what many of us consider a basic utility, i.e. good Internet and cell phone service, is unfortunately non-existent. Imagine your life without decent telecom services. You can\u2019t talk to your friends and family. You can\u2019t do simple things like browse the Internet, shop online, send emails or watch Netflix. And let\u2019s not even imagine an emergency and not being able to reach out for help.\u00a0Gilbert Darrell, Founder of Horizon Communications, has a global vision, and he shares it with us.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests:\u00a0Gilbert Darrell It&#8217;s smack-dab in the middle of Consensus 2018 and we give our thoughts.
