We are attempting to provide you with details and information from the people who are creating projects, and we are not giving advice. Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Dan Gailey from SynapseAI. Until now, people have given their data away to companies in exchange for centralized access to application and services. Examples include uploading and tagging photos, tracking and sharing your location and access to purchase history, to name a few. To provide a fair and balanced intelligence available to all equally, we must create AI economies that any agent can participate in and receive some reward for doing so. Enter Synapse AI. Synapse AI solves this problem by tokenizing an agent&#8217;s work on the Synapse AI market using SYN utility tokens, thus facilitating an economy between participants and transferring value to those participants. This accelerates a system that grows beyond the means of capacity of any one single company or organization. By opening this data and using machine learning models through decentralized marketplace formats on the blockchain, and by tokenizing contributors, we can create syndicates that provide the greatest benefit to users everywhere.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/synapse.ai\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/synapse.ai\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Dan Gailey, CEO Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
