The first song they released is called \u201cMyceliated\u201d and is essentially about fungus and the effect it has on the universe and the human experience as well as decentralization and how bitcoin can end wars. \u00a0All of this goes to show the group is planning to keep accepting Bitcoin payments for future releases. Lead singer Henry, and drummer Andrew join us in the studio to chat about the process and more. Myco\u2019s style of music is all about expressing the psychedelic dream of life. In a way, it was only a matter of time until they ventured into the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.<\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1394\" src=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Myco-OpenBazaar-Bitcoin-e1474527954261.jpg\" alt=\"myco-openbazaar-bitcoin-e1474527954261\" width=\"1000\" height=\"563\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Myco-OpenBazaar-Bitcoin-e1474527954261.jpg 1000w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Myco-OpenBazaar-Bitcoin-e1474527954261-300x169.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Myco-OpenBazaar-Bitcoin-e1474527954261-768x432.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Myco-OpenBazaar-Bitcoin-e1474527954261-450x253.jpg 450w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/10\/Myco-OpenBazaar-Bitcoin-e1474527954261-610x343.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests:\u00a0Kyle Henry &amp; Andrew MacIntyre Ever since OpenBazaar was released, content creators immediately took a liking to this decentralized marketplace approach.
