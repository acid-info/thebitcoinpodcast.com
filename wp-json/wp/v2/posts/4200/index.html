Uncloak is the world&#8217;s first blockchain powered cyber threat solution putting businesses one step ahead of hackers. Uncloak\u2122 is a unique and fully scalable blockchain powered technology that enables businesses to monitor, protect themselves against and eliminate cyber threats, staying one step ahead of the hacker. Uncloak will build its own threat detection database by using advanced AI technology to crawl the public and private internet looking for the latest cyber security threats, which are converted into security signatures and added to the Uncloak threat detection system to check if the vulnerabilities exist across the subscribed client base networks and infrastructure. Where vulnerabilities exist, the end user will be notified immediately so that corrective action can be taken.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/uncloak.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/uncloak.io\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Tayo Dada, CEO and Founder Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
