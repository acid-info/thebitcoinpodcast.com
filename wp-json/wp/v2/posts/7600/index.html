Andreas comes on our show to complete the trilogy of appearances to give us some peace of mind in an otherwise crazy last couple of weeks. The bitcoin and open blockchain community is drowning in corporate propaganda. Objective, independent and strong voices that are not beholden to promoting special interests can make a huge difference in the narrative. And well, if you are intending on listening to this week&#8217;s episode, there is a good chance you\u2019ve probably seen some of his work already and you realize how much time, money, and effort goes into producing original content with an independent perspective. What you might not know is that almost all of the content that we produce is both free and open-source, and will remain so forever. That is the spirit Andreas functions on as well.
