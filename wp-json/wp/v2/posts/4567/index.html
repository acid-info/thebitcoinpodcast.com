Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Tom Anderson of Devvio. Blockchain technology has grown over the past decade by providing trustless and highly robust solutions for maintaining distributed ledgers. However, in spite of the many different blockchain approaches that currently exist, there are a number of challenges that have not been solved in a single solution. Various approaches provide parts of the solution, but a single protocol that addresses all of these major challenges is still needed. The Devv Protocol was designed component by component to solve all of the problems described above. The DevvProtocol uses its own consensus algorithm, known as Proof-of-Validation. With Proof-of-Validation as our foundation, the Devv Protocol was designed to provide compelling solutions for the challenges of governance, scalability (transactions\/second), volatility, smart contract expense, exorbitant fees, privacy, immediacy (transaction authentication speed), energy use, supply issuances, and protection from fraud\/theft\/loss.<\/p>\n<p>The goal of Devvio is to create the first truly scalable blockchain, as it includes a full set of needed capabilities in order to grow with minimal impact to operating costs, such as its sharding approach and its Devvnero implementation for fraud, theft, and loss.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/devv.io\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/devv.io\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Tom Anderson, CEO &amp; Founder Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
