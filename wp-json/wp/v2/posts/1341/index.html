It\u2019s about the thousands of sensors within that Tesla communicating with the road and other infrastructure, or knowing that a command to brake or swerve is a legitimate command that comes from the driver or another trusted subsystem. This week we invite Blockchain\u00a0specialist and steategy analyst from <a href=\"http:\/\/www.chainofthings.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Chain of Things<\/a>, Mr. Conor Colwell, to the show to discuss cryptography, security and IoT industries globally. Chain of Things is set up to explore all security applications within blockchain IoT and look at the development of open-standards for the industry to use.
