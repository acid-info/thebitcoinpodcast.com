As a big fan of their music, we&#8217;ve known them to drop lines about crypto in their songs from time to time. After a half decade hiatus they&#8217;ve returned with their new album Special Edition Grand Master Deluxe and have graced us with their time for a little Q&amp;A. Their new song titled \u201cRipple\u201d is out today, and it\u2019s the ultimate cryptocurrency anthem for partying hard. \u201cThey taking bitcoin in the strip club\u201d is the chant for the hook. We invite them to come on the show this week to talk about a variety of topics, from the music industry, to crypto, and they even spit a freestyle for us!<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-algn:left\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;text-align:center;\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay\" class=\"youtube_embed_iframe\"    allowFullScreen=\"true\" style=\"width:640px; height:300px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/XR5UcrUY3Vo?autoplay=0&theme=dark&loop=0&fs=1&showinfo=1&modestbranding=0&iv_load_policy=1&color=red&autohide=1&disablekb=0&enablejsapi=1&version=3\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<p>\u2117 Propelr Music Released on: 2018-05-11<\/p>\n<p>Composer: Antoine Reed<br \/>\nComposer: Evan Ingersoll<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: The Cool Kids Sir Michael Rocks and Chuck Inglish (known collectively as &#8216;The Cool Kids&#8216;)\u00a0 have been busy in the booth as a duo again.
