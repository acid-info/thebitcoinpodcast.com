Lots of topics in this episode as Jeremy Epstein joins us. For example, we&nbsp;talk a bit about what Bitcoin Cash needs to do to increase their marketing efforts. Branding: you need to convince people that a &#8220;new product&#8221; (Bcash) is worth more than 9 years old recognized one (Bitcoin). There&#8217;s coins that are cheaper and faster than both the Bitcoin and BCH and didn&#8217;t succeeded in this mission after years; Branding is an issue. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s going to take promotion and demand from users.
