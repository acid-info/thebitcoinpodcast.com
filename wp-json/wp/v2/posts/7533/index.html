I\u2019m also supporting his stance to start working on DAO2.0 in an organized manner. The statements from the Cornell computer scientist, a longstanding critic of the project, on this episode come amid broad concern over developments at The DAO, a smart contract-based funding vehicle built with ethereum that has effectively collapsed following an exploit of a vulnerability within its smart contract code. I think we\u2019ve all been relieved to see the debate take on a more civil tone over the last day or two. In the interest of that spirit of respectful disagreement and helping us all to arrive at a considered consensus, Valerian Bennett, creator of PopChest and pioneer of microtransactions, joined us on the roundtable. This is it folks, we put the final nail in the coffin on the Dao talk.
