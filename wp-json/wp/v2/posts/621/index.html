She\u00a0is hoping to change all that, using a technology that could revolutionize the way music is produced and shared. Heap is one of a group of artists and coders who are using blockchain technology to launch and distribute music. Blockchain technology aims to record all recent transactions on a network and file them back as a permanent database. She\u2019s also the only female artist to have won a Grammy for engineering. So, I think she knows what she&#8217;s talking about. In addition, past guest Tony Sakich loved being on the show so much he joins us this week on the roundtable. IMOGEN HEAP IS ON THE SHOW!
