He is an advisor \/ investor to six startups.\u00a0He believes (as do we) that\u00a0Blockchain will usher in the era of decentralized computing. Simply put, decentralization technology allows assets to be stored in a network of computers accessed via the Internet. An asset can be a gaming token, a concert ticket, an authorship claim on a book, or a digital currency like Bitcoin.\u00a0This is a powerful idea: placing your trust in a network and not in a single entity like a government, a bank, or a multinational company.<\/p>\n<p>He is the founder of such a database.\u00a0Starting with the scale and queryability benefits of modern databases, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigchaindb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BigchainDB<\/a> adds blockchain characteristics of decentralization, immutability, and native assets. <a href=\"https:\/\/www.bigchaindb.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">BigchainDB<\/a> is for developers and enterprises that want to implement trading systems, clearing and settlement systems, decentralized energy grids, IoT and supply chain use cases, without sacrificing scale, security or performance.\u00a0BigchainDB was built as a result of seeing scalability as a fundamental barrier to wider adoption of blockchain technologies. Our patent-pending approach to \u201cblockchainify\u201d databases give enterprises the possibility to get up and running with blockchain technologies quickly.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Private Internet Access!
