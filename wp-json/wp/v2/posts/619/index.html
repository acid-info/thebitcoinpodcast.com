Oh, and he just created his own fork of bitcoin called Ryan X. Charles Bitcoin, and it&#146;s exactly the same as bitcoin, except MAX_BLOCK_SIZE is eight million instead of one million. No big deal. He left BitPay to join reddit as the &#8220;world&#8217;s first official cryptocurrency engineer&#8221; where he lead the development of reddit&#8217;s cryptoequity project, reddit notes. When reddit changed leadership, he joined BitGo to work on bitcoin multisig security. He&#8217;s been programming for over 20 years, and has experience with many technologies and languages, including Python, C, C++, and javascript. But like I said, we&#8217;re shifting AWAY from that stuff. Oh, what can I say, we love the nerdy stuff. Don&#8217;t worry, there are lots of dick and fart jokes sprinkled in so you can stay engaged.
