It was from that action that she gained the inspiration for creating the 12 Week Crypto Challenge. Jaide goes into deeper detail with Lyndon about exactly how this challenge came about, her plans to travel to 7 countries and 16 cities using nothing but crypto and they both reflect on their earlier days of having \u201cblockfolio syndrome\u201d during the 2017-2018 cryptocurrency bull run.<\/p>\n<p>Show notes: <a href=\"https:\/\/steemit.com\/dtube\/@bullpenpodcast\/g1qm6lbv\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/steemit.com\/dtube\/@bullpenpodcast\/g1qm6lbv<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Timestamps<br \/>\n00:00:00 \u2013 Preview<br \/>\n00:00:16 \u2013 Disclaimer<br \/>\n00:01:03 \u2013 Intro<br \/>\n00:01:52 \u2013 Interview<br \/>\n00:41:14 \u2013 Outro<\/p>\n<p>Where To Find The Bull Pen Podcast<br \/>\n<strong>Website:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/thebullpenpodcast.io\">http:\/\/thebullpenpodcast.io<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Discord:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/gNHJUN5\">https:\/\/discord.gg\/gNHJUN5<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Steemit:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/steemit.com\/@bullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/steemit.com\/@bullpenpodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>DTube:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/d.tube\/#!\/c\/bullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/d.tube\/#!\/c\/bullpenpodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Musicoin:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/musicoin.org\/nav\/artist\/0xb6dbbb7210cc5dd82fac57a56d25751c4637a98b\">https:\/\/musicoin.org\/nav\/artist\/0xb6dbbb7210cc5dd82fac57a56d25751c4637a98b<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Twitter:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/1BullPenPodcast\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/1BullPenPodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Facebook:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1bullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1bullpenpodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>LinkedIn:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/thebullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/thebullpenpodcast<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Where To Find Our Partners and Biggest Supporters<br \/>\n<strong>The Bitcoin Podcast Network:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/\">https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>ECC:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/ecc.network\/\">https:\/\/ecc.network\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>In Episode 29 of The Bull Pen Podcast, The Crypto Bully steps into the Bull Pen with Jaide Barclay.
