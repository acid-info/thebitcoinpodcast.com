Rafael shares the details of this amazing journey with Lyndon and talks about discovering a market when one could purchase stolen wallets still containing the original owner\u2019s belongings and sneaking in to meet the creator of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin. He also speaks on the documentary he is currently developing showcasing his travels around the world, and his new book \u201cStolen Wallets and Where to Find Them\u201d which includes a word puzzle wallet prize in Bitcoin that is still up for grabs.<\/p>\n<p>Show notes:<\/p>\n<p>Timestamps<br \/>\n00:00:00 \u2013 Preview<br \/>\n00:00:26 \u2013 Disclaimer<br \/>\n00:01:13 \u2013 Intro<br \/>\n00:02:02 \u2013 Interview<br \/>\n01:13:16 \u2013 Outro<\/p>\n<p>Where To Find The Bull Pen Podcast<br \/>\n<strong>Website:<\/strong> <a href=\"http:\/\/thebullpenpodcast.io\">http:\/\/thebullpenpodcast.io<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Discord:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/discord.gg\/gNHJUN5\">https:\/\/discord.gg\/gNHJUN5<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Steemit:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/steemit.com\/@bullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/steemit.com\/@bullpenpodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>DTube:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/d.tube\/#!\/c\/bullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/d.tube\/#!\/c\/bullpenpodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Musicoin:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/musicoin.org\/nav\/artist\/0xb6dbbb7210cc5dd82fac57a56d25751c4637a98b\">https:\/\/musicoin.org\/nav\/artist\/0xb6dbbb7210cc5dd82fac57a56d25751c4637a98b<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Twitter:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/1BullPenPodcast\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/1BullPenPodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>Facebook:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1bullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/1bullpenpodcast<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>LinkedIn:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/thebullpenpodcast\">https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/company\/thebullpenpodcast<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Where To Find Our Partners and Biggest Supporters<br \/>\n<strong>The Bitcoin Podcast Network:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/\">https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/<\/a><br \/>\n<strong>ECC:<\/strong> <a href=\"https:\/\/ecc.network\/\">https:\/\/ecc.network\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>\ufeff In Episode 35 of The Bull Pen Podcast, The Crypto Bully steps into the Bull Pen with Rafael Hauxley also known as The Bitcoin Traveler.
