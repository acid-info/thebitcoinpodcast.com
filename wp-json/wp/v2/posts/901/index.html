His math holds up though and we find out the problem with proof of work is that it is completely mistaken. Satoshi made a fundamental mistake and we&#8217;re just going to have to get over it. And his mistake was right there in the whitepaper; it says, &#8220;one CPU is one vote&#8221;. And there&#8217;s nobody who is going to deny that one CPU is no longer one vote. What we really have to come to terms with is it&#8217;s basically centralized from the very day in 2012 when there was a high number of miners and ASICs came in and mining started to centralize. And it&#8217;s centralizing exponentially; we don&#8217;t know the numbers but I think almost everyone can feel it. Also, 10 year future predictions!\u00a0And for all you technophobes out here don\u2019t get confused. This is remarkably simple math, very easy to understand and after listening to this episode\u00a0you\u2019ll be able to explain this phenomenal new technology to your techie friends.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: James D&#8217;Angelo This week we get James D&#8217;Angelo in the studio to explore his new data and stance that miners are in trouble.
