Really, it\u2019s kind of a mess. As an engineer, when you see a system full of technical debt and bad design choices, there\u2019s only one conclusion you can reach: this thing is due for a rewrite. That, in large part, is what made our guest, Haseeb Qureshi, catch the crypto bug. In June 2017, he decided the blockchain space was too interesting to sit on the sidelines. He said goodbye to Airbnb so I could pursue crypto full-time. Since then he&#8217;s worked on some security research, did a lot of writing and speaking, and taught a course on cryptocurrencies at the Bradfield School of Computer Science. We have a great chat with Haseeb, amongst other things! In addition, Dee and Cello chat about the\u00a020 Most Influential Blockchain and Cryptocurrency Experts list and pick it apart!<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Haseeb Qureshi If you work in payments fraud, you get an appreciation for the weaknesses of our financial infrastructure.
