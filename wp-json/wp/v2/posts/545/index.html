If you use Bitcoin, you definitely know that Bitcoin needs to become more practical. It\u2019s great for cross border transactions but it doesn\u2019t seem ready for the mainstream. Merchants are often stuck in their ways, hard to persuade, and building additional infrastructure takes time and costs money. What if I told you there was a way to buy things with bitcoin without having to wait for merchants to accept Bitcoin? That&#8217;s right,\u00a0Tap &amp; Pay using Bitcoin at any NFC-enabled point-of-sale terminal on the planet, with <a href=\"https:\/\/plutus.it\/\" target=\"_blank\">Plutus<\/a>, suckas!\u00a0It is powered by a Decentralized Exchange Network (DEX), which traders can use to buy and sell Bitcoin in return for fiat at the checkout. Merchants do not need to directly accept any digital currencies and customers can convert their balance into fiat on-the-go. Feel like you&#8217;re in a dream? Well let us pinch you! This is why it\u2019s time for a new era of payments. Plutus merges both blockchain technology and existing international NFC infrastructure to bring contactless Bitcoin payments into the mainstream. CCO of Plutus Filip Martinka stops by to let you know how the revolution will be televised.<\/p>\n<p>Still not a believer? They\u00a0have just started a 1 week long bitcoin experiment, where they will spend an entire week paying only using bitcoin through the Plutus contactless payment app.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/147258101\" width=\"576\" height=\"320\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"Spending Bitcoin at M&amp;S for Groceries and Brunch at Bumpkin  - Day 1\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>It seems the long-awaited Mycelium Card Network (MCN) is on the horizon.<\/p>\n<div class=\"embedded-video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/145882339\" width=\"1140\" height=\"641\" frameborder=\"0\" title=\"MyCelium - Card\" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen><\/iframe><\/div>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy our content and would like to see us get more amazing guests and spread the word of freedom?
