What exactly does that mean? Well, if you follow the show, it means we get together with some friends, drink drinks, light some stoogies, and chat about bitcoin and blockchain topics. Enjoy all the benefits of pouring a nice adult beverage into a functionally designed vessel of your choice, whilst chatting about finance, all without the repercussions, like the frequent 24-hour hangovers, the unsafe hook-ups, the weight gain, etc. Our homie Andrew joins us on the show who has NO CLUE what bitcoin is. We educate him and Marcello has to defend himself on why knowing the identity of the probable creator of bitcoin is important. Remember, sweetness is perceived more on the tongue than in the nose, so press play and drink us in, folks.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, every drunk episode we include a specialized drink for you to sip alongside us as you listen.
