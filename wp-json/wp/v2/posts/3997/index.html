The blockweave revolutionises the traditional, useless, high-energy output of typical blockchains. The Arweave is based on a new consensus mechanism called \u2018proof of access\u2019, which instead of producing the negative externality of high energy consumption, produces a positive externality; that of low-cost, permanent on-chain storage for the very first time.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"http:\/\/arweave.org\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">arweave.org<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Sam Williams Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
