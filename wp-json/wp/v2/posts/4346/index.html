What is pushing the price down? Is it market cycles, ETF discussions, or perhaps it is because\u00a0ICOs have sold nearly 100,000 ETH in the past 30 days? In addition to that we chat a bit about mass adoption and how hardware awareness can attribute to that. For instance, the new Grid+ Lattice provides a technical solution to not only use cryptocurrencies with automated systems, but also creates a hardware\/software system that enables a non-technical person, say my mother, to safely and easily participate in the cryptocurrency ecosystem.<\/p>\n<p>Lastly, swinging by the studio is Dr. Saifedean Ammous to chat about his new book.\u00a0And it comes from a well researched scholarly point of view without the highly technical details of bitcoin that are beyond the grasp of many of us. Saifedean\u2019s work provides a wealth of information and a much needed foundation for multiple future in-house debates within the bitcoin maximalist community.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Saifedean Ammous This week, the price is so bonkers the boys can&#8217;t ignore it any longer.
