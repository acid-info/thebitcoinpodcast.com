In the past, he\u2019s worked on peer-to-peer systems of various kinds. He was behind Karma, the first peer-to-peer currency with a distributed mint, and he also built Credence, a peer-to-peer reputation scheme that counteracted spam and mislabeled files. Emin has also built many other academic peer-to-peer systems, and has worked to defend some of the most popular ones in court. As we near episode 50, we hope you continue to find these discussions of distributed systems, operating systems and systems engineering to be thought provoking.
