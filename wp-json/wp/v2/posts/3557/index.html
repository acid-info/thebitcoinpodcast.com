We are attempting to provide you with details and information from the people who are creating projects, and we are not giving advice. Please do proper due diligence when considering investments.<\/p>\n<p>Today we talk with Vytautas Karalevi\u010dius from Bankera. Bankera is building a digital bank to last for the blockchain era. As a traditional bank, Bankera&#8217;s services fit into three groups:<\/p>\n<p>Payments including payment accounts with personal IBAN, debit cards, interbank foreign exchange rates and payment processing. All services will support both traditional fiat currencies as well as cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, DASH, NEM, ERC20 compliant tokens and others. In the long term, Bankera will implement innovative solutions such as gross-domestic-product (GDP) linked currencies and the use of exchange traded funds as a substitute for money.<\/p>\n<p>Loans and deposits will be a key competitive edge as well as core service of Bankera. Current deposits will receive interest just as savings do. All Bankera clients will be able to benefit from higher interest rates due to proprietary information about borrowers&#8217; cash flow, as most loans will be given to business clients who use the payment processing solution.<\/p>\n<p>Investments will consist of low-cost investment products such as exchange traded funds (ETFs), crypto-funds (a portfolio of various cryptocurrencies and crypto tokens) as well as roboadvisory solutions for wealth management. Eventually, Bankera will offer investment banking services including financing corporate strategies of our business clients.<\/p>\n<p>Enjoy!<\/p>\n<p>Link:<br \/>\n<a href=\"https:\/\/bankera.com\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https:\/\/bankera.com\/<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Vytautas Karalevi\u010dius, CEO Welcome to Announcements with Host No. 2, Demetrick Ferguson, a show that provides you details on current events, upcoming projects in the blockchain space, and token offering details.
