Lisk had an Initial Coin Offering (ICO) early 2016 and collected 14,000 Bitcoin. You do the math on that. That&#8217;s Arab money right there, son. Since the launch of Lisk there was a lot of confusion about what it really is, and what it enables people to do in the future. While it\u2019s true that you can implement practically everything into a Lisk sidechain, Max believes that the blockchain space\u00a0is big enough to have several projects solving the same issues. Lisk is so very promising as a technology. The focus on fast-buck is a shame in all crypto-land. It&#8217;s the possibilities which are really exciting. Not saying people shouldn&#8217;t make money .. but money, imho, is better seen as a means to an end, and that end here is enhanced human communication and commerce. Max gladly came on our show to clean up some misunderstandings, and explain briefly what Lisk is and what it isn\u2019t. LISK will go to the moonnn; only need patience!<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Max Kordek Part II of the Steven McKie character piece wraps up and in addition, this episode we are talking with Max Kordek, the founder of a new decentralized platform called Lisk.
