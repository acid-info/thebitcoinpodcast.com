Oh, and SOulja Boy&#8217;s new bitcoin song. Spoiler alert: It&#8217;s garbage!<\/p>\n<p>For our guest, we are incredibly excited to welcome Alena Vranova back to the show as Head of Strategy and Business Development for Casa. Alena is best known as the co-founder of SatoshiLabs and Trezor. She served as CEO of SatoshiLabs for 4 years, where they brought the first widely successful bitcoin hardware wallet to market. She is, quite frankly, a legend in the crypto space and we couldn\u2019t be happier to learn from her this episode.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Donate:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>&#8211; BTC: 1DzakJiMj9cTkQiujPjC5KJkCGUdvsWJEP<br \/>\n&#8211; ETH: 0x7A6b92ac5A64A2A5161D89cb980fe4c50E888dCA<br \/>\n&#8211; LTC: LSrAehXcciL7PhgaeiykK9pW7cqMHLUh9N<br \/>\n&#8211; ERC20: 0x5339f93ea94C4795D649D7C6EcfdD01dC4Cf5d2E<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: Alena Vranova This week we chat a bit about the Bitcoin &#8216;Breakthrough&#8217; which claims block size increase is possible without hard fork.
