Then we invite a Grammy Award winning musician in the studio to join us in the fun. RAC\u2019s (real name Andr\u00e9 Allen Anjos) released his fifth LP titled EGO back in July and what makes this particular release so special is because he ended up releasing the 1st complete music album using the ethereum blockchain. RAC recently got acquainted with the blockchain technology and saw he could have a more creative approach to music. So, naturally, that is where we came in. RAC has worked with startup Ujo Music on the release, building on its previous high-profile blockchain project with artist Imogen Heap, who also has been on our show. But, let&#8217;s be real, you can find plenty of articles online claiming \u201cblockchain\u201d will benefit artists. There are fewer with specifics on how.<\/p>\n<div style=\"text-algn:left\"><span style=\"display:inline-block;text-align:center;\"><iframe allow=\"autoplay\" class=\"youtube_embed_iframe\"    allowFullScreen=\"true\" style=\"width:640px; height:300px\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/Q21YoXjShdo?autoplay=0&theme=dark&loop=0&fs=1&showinfo=1&modestbranding=0&iv_load_policy=1&color=red&autohide=1&disablekb=0&enablejsapi=1&version=3\"><\/iframe><\/span><\/div>\n<p><strong>Tour Dates:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-2544\" src=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1020\" height=\"1020\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o.jpg 1020w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-150x150.jpg 150w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-300x300.jpg 300w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-768x768.jpg 768w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-180x180.jpg 180w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-600x600.jpg 600w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-450x450.jpg 450w, https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2017\/08\/20861570_10155472193812667_4894225441415899997_o-610x610.jpg 610w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1020px) 100vw, 1020px\" \/><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Guests: RAC 150 episodes baby!
