Perhaps a less exciting nature of a savings&#8230;just like a glacier, is how terribly boring and unexciting it is. &nbsp;It doesn&#146;t move much, and it looks a little stagnate to be honest; nevertheless, if a glacier is well kept and can&nbsp;look breathtaking. &nbsp;Treat bitcoin like money and it will become money&#8230;go ahead and save&nbsp;some.<\/p>\n<p>Now, this is the most tricky aspect of cash. &nbsp;How in the world does one invest bitcoin? &nbsp;And, in&nbsp;my opinion, bitcoin takes the main tricks out of investing naturally. &nbsp;It is designed as a&nbsp;deflationary currency. &nbsp;Under one simple condition, one simple if&shy;then. IF (adoption becomes&nbsp;massive), THEN(bitcoin gains immense value). &nbsp;If you have been in this game as long as I, then you &nbsp;also know adoption is no easy feat. &nbsp;Incepting psyches is no easy feet. &nbsp;Well, often times,&nbsp;in order to get have what you want, doing another action causes your wants to intersect with fruition. Let&#146;s revisit our metaphor, and liken investments as tributaries of our Amazonian flow. &nbsp;The denotation of a tributary in this context, a river or stream flowing into a larger body of water.<\/p>\n<p>Well, that is a very well put metaphor for how investing begins. &nbsp;Tributaries start as a tiny route for water that doesn&#146;t want to travel down the path of the rest of the water in the system, and it starts eroding its way toward new paths and new possibilities. &nbsp;Some tributaries become sources of power and influence, for instance, the Missouri River is a tributary of the Mississippi River here in the USA. The Missouri river was such a massive tributary we went ahead and started calling it a river. Since, bitcoin is deflationary start to view its innate properties as a cash system as that main river, the Amazon, or the Euphrates, or the Mississippi. &nbsp;The investment opportunities may be murky and unknown at the moment; but, natural erosion of the current landscape is bound to happen and new cash flows will create new sources of power. &nbsp;Try to find those new tiny paths and turn it into a Missouri River! Treat bitcoin like money and it will become money&#8230;go ahead and invest some.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Time and time again we bitcoiners are faced with theories of what will spark mass adoption.&nbsp;Different ways to release the floodgates to the world&#146;s first global currency. &nbsp;And, if you have&nbsp;enough skin in the game, then your definition of bitcoin is much more holistic than it&#146;s initial&nbsp;application as currency. &nbsp;Be that as it may, let&#146;s [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":3,"featured_media":303,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"nf_dc_page":"","unlock_protocol_post_locks":"","publish_to_discourse":"","publish_post_category":"","wpdc_auto_publish_overridden":"","wpdc_topic_tags":"","wpdc_pin_topic":"","wpdc_pin_until":"","discourse_post_id":"","discourse_permalink":"","wpdc_publishing_response":"","wpdc_publishing_error":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[6],"tags":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/3"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=397"}],"version-history":[{"count":4,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":401,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/397\/revisions\/401"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/303"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=397"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=397"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/thebitcoinpodcast.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=397"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
