Or maybe earlier last year when Imogen Heap filled us in on Mycelia? Well, let&#8217;s apply these services and get some feedback from an audience that could benefit from it. Our guest is a proud creative leader in the city of Austin, and obviously, a proud hip-hop artist who is striving to break into the industry. Chris fucks with himself. Most of the time. Honestly, it might depend on when and where you catch him. That\u2019s to say that the Austin\u00a0representative is like the rest of us\u2014surfing on waves of self-confidence, enduring periods of self-doubt, and searching for a sustainable balance. Chris&#8217; demeanor is passive yet perceptive, and when he speaks, he sounds like he does performing: as if you are a microphone to woo.<\/p>\n<p>In 2015, Chris Omenihu founded <a href=\"http:\/\/www.influencehumans.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Human Influence<\/a> in order to create a platform on which to speak, sing and spread his message about cultural inclusivity. Since its inception, this &#8220;taste-making, creative community&#8221; has evolved to be a culmination of Chris&#8217;s interests, shaped by his experiences in Austin. So if anyone can appreciate what we do, and take time out to listen to new technologies, it is him.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, we are joined on this episode with our Merch director Dillon!<\/p>\n<p><iframe loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/AMS0d7b0Q5U\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><strong>Private Internet Access!
