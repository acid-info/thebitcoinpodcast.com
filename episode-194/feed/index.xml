					<description><![CDATA[Funny Money One day my hips were way out of whack, Sciatica down my leg and pain in my back. &quot;You need to see a really good chiropractor!, Someone said. (But money was a huge factor.) So I delayed and most stoically, I put it off, Until it hurt just to laugh, sneeze or cough! Finally, I could no longer stand or bear it. I could no longer eat nor sleep, I swear it! Someone then drove me to the Chiro-quack Who knew just how to crack my aching back. I lay faced down on his long cool clinic table, Wondering what, what could he do, if able. He pulled one leg, said, &quot;This one&#039;&#039;s short &quot;How can that be? I asked. He gave a snort. &quot;It&#039;&#039;s obvious, he said, &quot;It&#039;&#039;s as clear as glass. And then he whacked me on my aching ass. Swift went his hand on my left cheek pocket, And deftly swift he withdrew my bulging wallet. &quot;This, he cried, &quot;is the cause of all your pain! &quot;Never, ever wear it in back, never, ever again! The he twisted and cracked me like a pretzel. Sweet relief! I was filled with gratitude, forgetful Of all earthly and monetary cares, loss or profit. I had prepaid, so I happily left without my wallet! Friends, money is funny, (it&#039;&#039;s a lot like food or sex) Too little makes us sad, too much, fat, tired wrecks! If your life balance gets out of whack, like mine did, Abstain, diet, slim your wallet down, share! Like I did. &lt;a href=&quot;http://essaywritekd.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;cheap custom essays&lt;/a&gt;]]></description>
