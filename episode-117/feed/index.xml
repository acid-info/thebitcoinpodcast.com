					<description><![CDATA[Guys,

If you are not known as a member of a specific ethnic, religious, subcultural group yourself, don&#039;t make joking remarks about that group or the fact that someone belongs to that group.

(Especially don&#039;t try to be funny using cliches that a member of that group already has heard thousands of times in her/his life.)

Totally uncool.]]></description>
