					<description><![CDATA[I recently started listening to this podcast and love the way Rhys conducts his &#039;interviews.&#039; Listening to Rhys get his guests to speak freely and engage in intellectual conversation is quite fascinating.

I found this to be an extremely interesting conversation about the Fermi Paradox, effective altruism, consequentialism, luck, probabilistic thinking, and futurism in general. I especially loved learning about Double Crux, as I have been doing this for a long time at a subconscious level without really understanding what I was doing up until now, and think this will be an a very important way for us as a society to progress. 

Keep up the good work]]></description>
