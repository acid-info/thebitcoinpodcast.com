					<description><![CDATA[I am pro Storj. Constructive feedback as a fan: stop saying you are just S3 compatible. One rule of startups is that if you are not 10x better than your competitor on some dimension then it is not worth doing. I think Storj is attempting be equivalent to S3 but to win on cost. If so, double down on that and stop being shy about it. Good luck. -a storj supporter]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Let&#039;s be clear. Ronnie is really speaking from skepticism. What I heard from his interview, and what was his turning point was that the company didn&#039;t get back with him. The names given didn&#039;t actually include middle names? Really? Who introduces themselves by their full legal name? No one does. That&#039;s who. That held no merit and was actually quite funny. He &quot;not sure&quot; if the gold is legit? Doesn&#039;t mean it&#039;s not. And plenty of people have worked for companies and industries that get shut down, hence the mortgage industry and stock market took a huge fall. Doesn&#039;t mean that the employees knowingly had a hand in shadyness, and If they did, they would have felonies to follow. He needs to be real clear. There is much at steak for all parties involved. Ronnie in poor judgement posted the personal phone numbers and email adresses on all of his public social forums of the people he is accusing of being scamers. What if in fact he is wrong? That&#039;s just unethical and lacks integrity and shows utter disregard and. professionalism and points to another example of how he reacts recklessly without consideration. What if he in fact, at least for right now is ruining people&#039;s investment all due to him emotional erupting to such a degree that it is causing red flags, when in fact the only issue is that there are time delays? Again, he should be sure on what he refers to and is suggesting before going public. The irony in this, is that that is exactly what he claims he did the first time. What if in fact Ronnie just fucked himself out of all the shares he has purchased because he single handedly kept the price of DIG down due to this tantrum and is actually hurting himself and all of his investors that followed him? While he is suggesting it is a scam, based in full speculation no less, and people not getting back with him, he didnt have one legitimate truth to back it up with. There is more proof that this is legitimate and zero proof that it is not. Fear is a funny thing, and that&#039;s all that is behind this scam mentality. Until all the facts are in, it is not a time to make declarations. He was demanding timelines and threatening the company that if they don&#039;t provide timelines that he will take action. There is zero evidence that it is a scam. Ronnie snaped out. His pride got the best of him when he started to demand timelines and now he needs everyone to go fuck themselves. I&#039;m pretty sure he has mastered that himself... All by himself... You know, he works alone! I think he revealed himself perfectly on this interview. He just can&#039;t reason, so its &quot;everyone else&quot;... Just like on the interview it everyone else, and just like with DIG and Arbitrade, it&#039;s them! &quot;Damn it... The have middle names and didnt disclose that&quot;... Says Ronnie.  Lol okay Ronnie Moas! Good detective work!]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/episode-236/#comment-486&quot;&gt;Former Moas Subscriber&lt;/a&gt;.

Ronnie Moas charges $1200 or $600 for his crypto recommendations per year depending if your net worth is below or above $50,000. 

Ronnie Moas pumped this coin more than any coin I’ve seen in the space. Sure he did say not to put more than 5%-6% of your money into crypto, but shilled this name almost on a daily basis. 

He even went so far as telling his subscribers to put on a diaper because Dig was going to explode at any minute. Also, telling his subscribers that he owned more Dignity than Bitcoin because he had so much conviction in the name. Hinting his subscribers to be overweight Dig. 

He used his celebrity in the space to mislead his subscribers and doesn’t want to take any responsibility. You fucked yourself Ronnie. Not resubscribing.]]></description>
