					<description><![CDATA[Appreciated Corey putting the Ethereum forks into context. The attacker[s] has/have been paying a lot of money to expose bugs in a nascent technology and we should be thankful.

I don&#039;t think the Ethereum community look like fools at all. Both foundation and client developers (i.e. not just Vitalik, who is the most publicly facing one) have all been on the same page and are simply iterating the technology by repricing computation in a more intelligent way. No one I know cares about ETC or any future derivation thereof -  we are just trying to build the best network we can.

I think it&#039;s important to remember that it&#039;s still early days.]]></description>
