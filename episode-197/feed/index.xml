					<description><![CDATA[Been listening to you dudes for over a year. Appreciate the show and content with all sincerity. A word about Chopra tho...yeah he sometimes conflates quantum mechanics and spirituality but the dude has a whole book called The Path to Love which doesn&#039;t mention psuedoscience at all. It was a thought provoking read and a provocative commentary about intimacy between people. Charlatan would be a harsh word. He&#039;s confused like the rest of us.  Just my two satoshis. Thanks again for all the content on the network. Dj&#039;s neverending story is an awesome new addition.]]></description>
