The content works exponentially, you should have waited to the ten minute mark...content out the wazoo.  Imagine what kind of mind-blowing content you could have had at the 1 hour mark?]]></description>

My answer got too long, so I just published it on our blog.

Hey Rob,

That intro is an inside joke between us, but if you keep listening then maybe one day you will know the secret.  In fact, the lore of that line, &quot;Just two guys,&quot; is deeply embedded in the interwebs. If you find the answer $10 in BTC goes to you my friend.  Yay for incentives to get to know us!]]></description>

Thank you for the help with the math. And, thank you even more for the listen.  In fact...you should listen to all of our past episodes and our future episodes to catch such monumental flubs.  

Thank you Victor T, I am forever humbled by your infinite math prowess.]]></description>

Thanks for spending the time to inform us on how much time you didn&#039;t spend with us.  :P

You&#039;ve got a lot of patience, and I bet you love small talk and banter.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[In reply to &lt;a href=&quot;/episode-53/#comment-191&quot;&gt;Rob&lt;/a&gt;.

I would say that manipulating scientific notation (or exponentials), although simple, isn&#039;t basic arithmetic.  I&#039;m also sure you&#039;ll say I&#039;m retarded for not doing the mental math, oh well.

I wasn&#039;t trying to be accurate, only getting an order of magnitude kind of thing to prove a completely different point, which I hope you didn&#039;t miss.  I will say, had I said what I was thinking without my terrible mental math exhibition, it would have come off much easier to understand.  

The written form of language allows us to be much more eloquent.  Having a recorded conversation... not so much.  We&#039;re working on it.

P.S. if you&#039;re worried about my &quot;math skills,&quot; I&#039;d be happy to discuss esoteric math topics with you.]]></description>

Thanks for the specifics, I wasn&#039;t trying to be accurate, only getting to a point, which I hope you didn&#039;t miss because you needed to correct me.  What was important is that Bitcoin will always allow for arbitrary amounts of value to be moved, regardless of the price of a single bitcoin.  

People aren&#039;t even capable of physically conceptualizing these large numbers, which is why scientific notation was even invented.  A good read about this can be found here http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/03/7-3-billion-people-one-building.html.]]></description>
