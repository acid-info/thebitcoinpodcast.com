					<description><![CDATA[Email is actually older than the internet, and was in fact a key technology that spurred the latter&#039;s development. An early example is MAILBOX at MIT in around 1965. By 1972 Ray Tomlinson invented the use of the &quot;@&quot; symbol for Arpanet email, an idea and use which of course has persisted to this day. 

It wasn&#039;t until the early-to-mid nineties, however, that significant public uptake of email occurred--so it took at least 20 years for &quot;adoption&quot; to happen. 

Patience, boys!]]></description>
