					<description><![CDATA[Thanks for the fan mail shout out and thoughtful response to my question last podcast (I should&#039;ve chosen a more enthralling name like McLovin). 

I find the conversation about Satoshi especially interesting. I agree with Marcello when he says that the identity of the probable creator is important. Say Satoshi owns a small majority of 1 million bitcoins, in 2013 that would have made him a billionaire. It&#039;s kind of deflating to think Craig Wright might be Satoshi because he sounds like such an asshole, but I digress. 

Also, kids these days are all about drinking the Sidewalk Slammer. I challenge one of you to drink it on the next drunk episode.]]></description>
